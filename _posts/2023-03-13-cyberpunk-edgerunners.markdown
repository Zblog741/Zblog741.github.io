**March 13, 2023.** *In this article I comment about the anime* Cyberpunk: Edgerunners *and comment on on ways I find it mirrors our current society, particularly drawing parallels between the seventies and the 2020's, raising contemporary and seemingly ever-green concerns, and on how I have personally related to this anime.* 
<!--more-->

*Cyberpunk: Edgerunners* is a rather unusual production for studio TRIGGER, being based on *Cyberpunk 2077*, a western videogame. Nevertheless, it is widely regarded as one of the best anime produced to date by them. Studio TRIGGER is known for their over-the-top action, but the true genius of studio TRIGGER and its predecesor Gainax has often been, in my opinion, the deep connections of their anime with Nietzschean moral philosophy; I plan to write on this in the future, making use of some rather lengthy notes I have, perhaps from when I had a better memory of Nietzsche's philosophy. In this ocassion they followed a different recipe as *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners* is not an original anime, but was mostly written by CD Projekt Red, the developers of the videogame. And as such, the creative input from TRIGGER was limited to certain aspects such as characters and animation. This article is not about aspects such as the animation and direction quality, as this extremely high quality anime speaks for itself in those regards. A little disclaimer: I haven't had the opportunity to play the game yet. 

In a different opportunity, I shall also write about the duality of *kibou* and *zetsubou* (hope and despair, in Japanese), which I find to be a common theme in many Japenese popular works of art or entertainment (manga, anime, videogames). This theme in particular can be heavily found in studio TRIGGER's anime productions. It has been my observation that no culture I have close personal knowledge of poses so much direct importance into these extremely important concepts, which dictate the biggest decisions we take in life. The duality of hope and despair is also present in *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners*, although in a more nuanced way as is more typical in western entertainment: in the form of tragic fate and tragic love, not too different to Shakespeare's *Romeo and Juliet*. Leaving the more philosophical considerations aside, I will limit myself to the beauty of *Cyberpunks: Edgerunners* as a tragedy and as a mirror to contemporary social problems. 

The action-filled single cour story told by this anime series is that of [David Martinez](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/David_Martinez){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, a brilliant but poverty-stricken seventeen year-old latino student who, upon the death of his mother and sole breadwinner, finds his way through as a mercenary in a hypercapitalistic, ultramilitaristic and neuroenhanced dystopic [cyberpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} world. Particularly, this story is located in the [New United States](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/New_United_States){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.

## I recommend watching *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners* before reading this article if you haven't, as **this article is full of spoilers**. 

While we do see some tragedy and moments of despair in TRIGGER anime, those are usually outgrown in one way or another. *Cyberpunks: Edgerunners* is perhaps different in the sense that there is an element of tragedy from the very first episode that cannot be shaken off until the conclusion of the anime, without necessarily giving that ambiance. Instead, the ambiance of the anime is of constant explosive action and of camaraderie, with its ups and downs. This mix of tragic fate and making honour to the name *edgerunner*… I find it to be extremely refreshing in the media. An edgerunner is someone who risks their life as part of a [mercenary](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Mercenary){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} group. Deep down we know how this sort of story is prone to end up, or rather, how it should end up. Yet, ever since David learns about his superhuman resistance to the military implant Sandevistan, he keeps repeating to himself that he is special, as he integrates as part of [Maine](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Maine_(Edgerunners)){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}'s cyberpunk crew and we are dragged along through his story. And at some point, we also want to see him succeed, and raise from the bottom to the top. *He is a child that is suddenly stripped from his mother and only loved one, and of any hope of getting anywhere in life, after all.* 

David could have gone to achieve success within the system, ie. [Arasaka](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Arasaka){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}'s benefit, but it was clear from the beginning that wasn't going to happen. Albeit David is shown as a resilient person, he is deeply in pain and in despair, with no prospects or direction in life. He quickly comes to the conclusion that his mother's wish for him to become an Arasaka corpo was simply not for him. It simply went against everything that made him who he was… In a society where becoming an Arasaka corpo was the only way to have a good life. This is not a story of bad decisions, but a tragedy about how who you are and how the conditions you start with eventually force you to waste your potential in order to survive and find meaning in life. It's about misfortune and the desperation of living in a despairful society.

## Some find his choices to be foolish, and particularly that his stubbornness to keep [chroming up](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberware){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} because he is "special" is foolish. I instead find it to be tragic. 

His decision to have Sandevistan implanted in the first place when he lost his mother was already guaranteed [cyberpsychosis](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberpsychosis){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} and likely death. I think many ignore how important this was for him: ***this story starts with a death wish***. During episode 1 we learn how the second his mother dies the world falls onto him; he is not even allowed into his apartment as the rent is overdue. The last straw was when David's classmate, Katsuo, called just to tell David his mother dying was karma, and that there's a lesson in all of this: "Your mother tried to live beyond her means and died. Don't make the same mistake. Drop out, Martinez". And while this message sounds ill intentioned… *He is right*. His mother's overwork was the reason she couldn't survive post-operation. *And that is tragic, because David knows Katsuo is right*. David drops out. And knowing well that he will most likely lose his mind to cyberpsychosis, he gets the Sandevistan implanted. But perhaps other than a short somewhat psychotic laugh, there is no indication he is negatively affected by the Sandevistan. He goes to school just to beat up Katsuo knowing fully well that will ruin any chance of ever getting a corpo job, and then in a very passing manner that anyone could easily miss, during episode 2 we see him trying to fit in with the people of the city, many of them addicted and homeless. At that point, there is no way back. His mental state is evident when in the skytrain he notices Lucy's mysterious striking hair once again, but this time his reaction is different in a despairful way, and in fact he tells Lucy "can't believe you're a petty thief". 

*Cyberpunk: Edgerunners* uses hope as a tragedy from the beginning. Have you ever worked your ass off for something, opened your eyes, and found that everything was actually stacked against you from the beginning? That you only wasted your time? **That the creeping feeling that you were never supposed to fight for something was probably right?** That you never had a chance, regardless of your efforts, regardless of whatever misfortune you had to fight through, or that you will never have a chance to prove yourself due to the conditions you were born into? David understood that, and understood it well. I'm confident that those with long term ambitions beyond the pursuit of capital who have had or have to fight through the need of capital or societal barriers will relate. 

David and Lucy's romance was incredibly ideal, and Lucy easily became David's love interest. She was to David the warmth and purpose he needed, and she showed David a way out. Yet his love for Lucy was also the reason of his eventual demise. Becoming an edgerunner was to give meaning to the efforts of David's passed mother through the Sandevistan, to give meaning to his death wish, and to find meaning in other people. Maine was the only one who'd be willing to give him a chance. Motivated by his 'love at first sight' for Lucy and his terrible and inescapable situation, David asks Maine for the opportunity to become an edgerunner. He chooses to keep digging down, because there is no way up. Had he tried to push through a more regular life, even with smarts and hard work it would have meant many years of poverty and sacrifice before he could find any sense of fulfilment in his life, if at all. He would have been so miserable he probably would have ended up killing himself; that *is* a normal outcome. 

Throughout the anime we see despair growing *silently* in David's heart, to end up consuming him. This is also why I consider the opening song "This fffire" by Franz Ferdinand as a genius election. David's burning soul and ambition, albeit lacking direction, to not only survive, but *to become*, to be above Arasaka and the injustice of the system, and make his loved ones' wills reality, was burning. As a comment on the below video puts it: "This song just fits so perfectly with the message of Cyberpunk. People can try to burn Night City to the ground, but in the end, they're the ones who get burned…". And we can see ***in the very opening*** that David's fate is none other than A BULLET TO HIS HEAD.

We are introduced to multiple concepts. A central one is [cyberpsychosis](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberpsychosis){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}. I do not think the cyberpsychosis David experienced is too different to the psychosis that a person will develop after going through the soul-crushing events David had to go through. The story of David is one of grit, and of how his environment forced him to continue on his path until his own way killed him. I find that this is a common sentiment in those who are willing to die for a purpose; in the pursuit of some form of Freedom. When you've been through hell and back, you become psycho. It's like that idiom, that you either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain, and is also why I love *Cybperpunk: Edgerunners* so much. 

## I think *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners* is not that dystopic compared to our world. Night City simply makes tragedy widespread and visible. 

The main difference is that there are no OP cyborgs and violence is much more common in developing countries rather than developed countries, although in the US you can also get plenty of gun violence. For instance, Chicago, [a financial hub of the US](https://www.businessinsider.com/ken-griffin-citadel-moving-headquarters-to-miami-from-chicago-2022-6?r=US&IR=T#:~:text=Citadel%2C%20which%20has%20been%20in,complaints%20about%20safety%20in%20Chicago.){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, has become rather famous for its gunfire violence. Night City is presented through quite a dark lens, but it's also true that there are vast differences in access to health care around the world and there is organised crime where life isn't worth much. Night city is analogous to… a city owned by a cyborg drug cartel (although it's not as if the US has never been [run by a drug cartel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_of_CIA_drug_trafficking#United_States){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}). **But that is real life for many people**. *Night City simply makes that visible.* 

There are places where that kind of violence is not unheard of, unfortunately. As a personal anecdote, I was overhearing a call a family member was having with a relative; the spouse of this relative living in the Latin American city I share roots with, was killed in their own home during a gathering with friends and family when police officers opened fired with a semi-automatic gun to take down a criminal gunman. Wounded innocents, and at least one fatality. The gunman fled.

Warning: the following next three paragraphs are "redpilling" about the financial system, as I draw parallelisms of the time during the golden age of cyberpunk to current times. 

The cyberpunk subgenre is characterized by mixing this kind of dystopic violence with widespread technological advancement. In my very superficial search I found this subgenre had a golden age in the 70s-80s. I suspect the popularity of the subgenre was heavily influenced by the sociopolitical circumstances at the time: the rapid development of technology, corporization and [stagflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stagflation.asp){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}. *A situation that we once again live to see*. In particular, in the Cyberpunk franchise, the [New United States of America](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/New_United_States){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} was a consequence of the materialization of fears that were widespread in the seventies and eighties, and that are becoming relevant again now in the current financial paradigm. The [Global Financial Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007-2008_financial_crisis){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, the [2019 liquidity crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2019_events_in_the_U.S._repo_market){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, the [2020 market crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, the [2021 Sneeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, the [2021 collateral crisis](https://www.thelondonfinancial.com/markets/reverse-repo-and-the-collateral-crisis){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, the attempt of a [Department of Justice financial crackdown in 2022](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-04/is-stock-market-rigged-bill-hwang-arrest-is-start-of-trading-crackdown){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, among others, are recent indicators of uncertainty. I could go on ad nauseam if I wanted. I mean, just during the days I've been writing this article the US had its [second biggest bank collapse in US history](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/10/silicon-valley-bank-collapse-how-it-happened.html){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} and we've [started to see bank runs](https://twitter.com/Dr_PhillipB/status/1634632068058722304?t=dkvXyIANNHzbmBUVe4q1_A){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}. 

Regarding the financial markets, the computarization of share certificates in the seventies being the birth of the first megacorporations, which you have most likely never heard of: one company being the legal holder of [the vast majority of US publicly traded shares](https://www.dtcc.com/about/businesses-and-subsidiaries/dtc){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}. Every EU country uses a similar system. Not to be confused with [the Megacorp structure](https://welcometothemachine.co){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} that holds the decision power. Yes, *the [monopolization of legal ownership](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Central_securities_depository){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} of the economy in our capitalist societies ocurred a long time ago*, during the rise of the cyberpunk subgenre. The current inflationary environment is mirroring the [Great Inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/1970s-great-inflation.asp){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} of the 1970s of Nixon's administration, as the fiat system is again put into question. In the Cyberpunk franchise, the New United States needed for a backing of the US dollar, a problem that according to the lore was resolved with the [invasion of Latin American countries](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Central_American_War){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} rich in oil reserves. I think this is becoming a real possibility as a relatively easy alternative to a last-resource land-backed interim currency like the Rentenmark during the Weimar Republic before a transition to a longer term store of value currency. In fact, the Nazi rise to power flourished in times of economic collapse. 

There is a widespread pessimism in the future of the US financial stability, from Dr. Michael Burry (aka. [BRRRRy](https://moguldom.com/338484/famous-big-short-investor-michael-burry-warns-weimar-like-hyperinflation-is-coming-to-america/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}) to Edward Witten ([my guy!](https://twitter.com/witten271/status/1611761523902353409){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} what are you doing here? LOL). These worries include the fall of the US as a modern empire, hyperinflation, a new great depression, or [the collapse of The System](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/The_Collapse){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} in general. Other worries include mass population control, [the use of CBDCs to limit our liberties](https://decrypt.co/83124/edward-snowden-cbdcs-are-cryptofascist-currencies-that-could-casually-annihilate-savings){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, the use of war as a means for economic prosperity (as has [happened for centuries](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2022/9/6/the-emergence-of-war-in-platos-republic){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}), the rise of market wars (which in my opinion is an inevitable outcome if nothing is done, but I digress), the birth of megacorporations by the obtention of systemic control, and more speculatively, [their](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/First_Corporate_War){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} [militarization](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Corporation#Corporate_Wars){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, which in my opinion would be a natural outcome if the US were to fall *as a nation*. A "collapse" is not something as rare as it may seem — it's just a matter of historical perspective. In my view, a world like the one that *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners* shows is not just a "what if", but *it is the natural tendency of human civilization*. The technology for [mass fear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fa9lVwHHqg){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} is one more puzzle piece that we are unlocking during the New Roaring 20's. Similarly, David's story is the natural outcome of a technologically developed world that has prioritized the interests of those in power over the common wellbeing. 

The motivations for war can be banal. If your choices are deep poverty or war and glory, what kind of choice is that, but an illusion for the frustrated and the ambitious? This is a dilemma that defines history and its great and dead men, and it is the dilemma David had to face. It has also often been the status quo of scientists throughout history; they have most often had better opportunities in the Industry of War. With humanity deepening into the [Information Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, I think there are some new moral issues to be considered, particularly how work in information and technology might impact the world. Artificial Intelligence is the obvious and popular example but finance should be too, and I can't stress that enough. 

The roughness of Night City presents other social problems that might hit closer to home. Access to healthcare being one of those. While this is more notorious in developing countries and particularly the US, the industrialized world where health care is supposed to be universal has raised this problem too. During the covid pandemic the health systems around the world were in a delicate position. As a result, even once everything was more or less under control, covid policies were prioritized over the *actual* health of the people. There are many stories about people being denied urgent health aid in Japan ([eg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48Ft0DKT-4U&ab_channel=Yunae){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}), and people have died in China [due to a fire](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/02/china/china-covid-lockdown-protests-2022-intl-hnk-dst/index.html){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} they were physically unable to escape from due to covid policies. Sometimes these anecdotes give an impression this wasn't happening in the western world; if that's your case I suggest to check twice. I for instance, was pretty much denied access to health care in England under the NHS because of fears that I *might* carry covid, which let my condition to deteriorate until I had an actual fucking ambulance called on me. 

Equality of academic opportunity is another illusion in a lot of the industrialized world. For instance, the lack of funding for UK masters is [notorious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXGKI9_QzyU&ab_channel=Kidology){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}. The government masters' loans are extremely poor in its conditions, and they normally only cover tuition fees. Doing a PhD after using the master's loan are a sure way to make it grow beyond escape (repayment) velocity with the government's usurer interest rates, especially if the goal is to pursue a career in academia where salaries are low. This creates a huge economic responsibility in the long run that sets back people who aren't from a wealthy background even more than a career in academia would aready do, assuming you have the funds to support yourself, to start with. The really funny thing is that fixing this is *cheap*. But that wouldn't happen because the UK is a country sold off to the gilt holders (let's be honest, this was never about the taxpayer) and where academic education is considered by the govenrment merely from an financial perspective.  In Spain, need-based financial aid barely covers a fraction of what's needed; about enough for food. Meanwhile, the EU prides itself on its lavish mobility scholarships but does nothing to actually require countries to guarantee funding for undergraduate studies for young people *in fucking need*. 

I can personally relate to David, at least to some extent. My goal all along was to do a master's degree and go on to a PhD. Once my parents' business blew up I was personally on the hook for more money than I'd be able to save in a decade, lost all prospect of work in Spain (would have my salary seized) and lost all prospect of master's studies in most of the world. Unexpectedly becoming chronically ill to the point I had to cram a semester into a week only further ruined my chances of getting any funding opportunity. I was rather lucky that I  had dedicated a lot of time to programming during my younger years and could get a decently paying starting salary. Yet even then close to one year of work would probably not be enough to save for my living costs during a master's degree. Imagine what it would be like with the minimum salary and trying to save for a four year long undergraduate degree? I was also relatively lucky I could stay with my parents while I looked for work, and that they funded my relocation; I myself most likely wouldn't even be eligible for homeless shelter in the UK with pre-settled status. The takeaway I have is that our current socioeconomic systems, in our progressive and peaceful western world, are not really more fair than that of primitive societies in peaceful times. Transporting this to the future in not so peaceful times is what gives cyberpunk a strong sense of reality. 

The funniest of my own circumstance is that I've been calling a financial crisis during the last two years which is just now starting to materialize, and I know there is a big risk I will lose my job to it even if everything is apparently great right now, but can do next to nothing about it. This sense of impotence and hopelessness is an extremely common outlook for working class young adults of today, that has been growing during the last decade or two due to the growing financial inequality and continuous stagflation. In fact, I would say this has degraded the industrialized nations to a ***lower* standard of life** for young people than most developing countries (having lived in both I have found other people from different countries agreeing with this). Which is why I think the timing of *Cyberpunk 2077* and *Edgerunners* is excellent. Every day that passes I question my own goals, just like David did, and on the daily I'm tempted to abandon my hopes and dreams, and to become the closest to an edgerunner as I could: to abandon hope in the system and pursue money more than anything. 

And, after this much pondering I'm feeling forced to ask… What the fuck have we accomplished to improve *fairness* in the human condition? While many metrics show human condition has improved a lot during the last couple hundred years, and that has indeed been the case, I can't but feel that we are falling short of what we could and should accomplish within the context of contemporary civilization. 

Warning: plenty of spoilers ahead. I really discourage to continue reading if you haven't watched the anime. 

## Coming back to the anime, 

Episode 6 serves as a pivotal moment. Maine and Dorio are surrounded. In his dip of cyberpsychosis, Maine kills [Dorio](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Dorio){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, the closest person Maine had to his heart. [MaxTac](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/MaxTac){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} is deployed. David wants to go help Maine, and Lucy tries to stop him "No, you can't! You got a death wish?" David ignores her warnings, and goes to aid Maine, who is starting to lose his mind to cyberpsychosis. Maine knows he's at his end, and David is visibly very nervous, as confronting MaxTac is a sure death. Maine finally tells David he can't do it, and asks him to run. The moment MaxTac burst into the scene, David is in extreme despair as he can't decide what to do in fear of letting anyone else die. By Maine's request, he finally chooses to run and let him die. But more importantly, David knew Lucy was waiting for him. This is when David rejects his death wish, for Lucy, as a tragical but beautiful demonstration of love.

In episode 7, Lucy eventually tells David her story as an Arasaka netrunner orphan trainee. David's hand is shaking due to all the chroming, and Lucy points to it "Haven't changed, have you? Still chasing someone else's dream", making reference to Maine's dream. David is later shown to start suffering of cyberpsychosis onset, and he kills an innocent woman, whose son had just gotten into Arasaka academy, during a dip into cyberpsychosis. He visits the [ripperdoc](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Doc_(Edgerunners)){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} to lighten on the chrome, but ends up unable to take the decision within his mental state. Doc makes clear to David that he will die like this, and Lucy asks him to use less cyberware, to which David responds he can't because Maine and his mom "had plans for me, left me things to do. Stuff I ain't done yet". He deeply regrets killing that woman and realizes he grew numb to death. He's not normal, he's different — he says. He tells Lucy she doesn't get it. And I seriously doubt he was talking about his resistance to cyberware. I have an interpretation on this: what I think he was actually trying to say, was that he had long accepted death. That he was going to make his mother's dream true and climb to the very top of Arasaka tower. That he was going to live for Maine the way Maine wanted to live. And that he was going to take Lucy to the moon. But that he never held any such will for himself. **That, is why David is different.** David tells Lucy she deserves a way out of this life. But by this he implies he's already accepted his place in it, as the will of those he loves. 

In episode 10, we're shown David mounting the cyberskeleton during a car persecution on the way to save Lucy. He starts laughing while he's dipping into cyberpsychosis, and for a moment we see him flash back to when he had just had the Sandevistan implanted, to a similar crazy laugh from the beginning of this story. His mind goes back to when his mom told him he has to raise all the way to the top of Arasaka. I interpret his laugh in an extremely beautiful, yet tragic way. When David had barely had the Sandevistan implanted, he laughed because he thought of using it to raise to the top of Arasaka, and make his mother's dream come true. Instead of doing it by becoming an Arasaka corpo, doing it his own way. Yet, he also laughed because he was in the same one-way street as those who had killed his mother. 

In the beautiful scene in the end, David tells Lucy that using the cyberskeleton (and thereby dying) was the only way he could save her. When Lucy tells him she only wanted for him to live, he responds "I ain't worth it, Lucy. Besides you, I got nothing else left. But you still have a dream to stick around for. Need you to see it through. That's my dream. Honestly, nothing else ever really mattered". *Here, he finally lets Lucy know that the fire of his soul, the despair and selfless will to his loved ones' dreams, and his tragedy of becoming no different to those who killed his mother, has been consuming him from the first day*. 

Rebecca shows courage to the very end, as she wants to protect David, and dies by the hand of Adam Smasher. David is finally killed by Adam Smasher from a shot in the head, just like in the opening credits. To really add to the tragedy here, David lived for the dreams of the people he loved, but in the end he didn't notice that Lucy's dream of going to the moon… Had become a dream of going to the moon with David. He lived a relatively fulfilling life thanks to Lucy and the friends he made, but *his* dream didn't require for him to live anymore. **I'd go as far as saying that *his dream* was to be put out of his despair**. Yet for the very reason he had Lucy and could save her, he could only die or become a cyberpsychopath. 

Death is the logical conclusion of despair. It's the reason people bring themselves to death. However, it's not about how we die, but about how we live. Yet some may attempt to seek glory in their death. Night City takes that to the extreme, in an apparently underwhelming way: 

> "You don't make a name as a Cyberpunk by how you live, but by how you die."

This sentence is repeated throughout the anime, making reference to cyberpsychosis. And although David is killed in the end, I believe the big resolution to this tragedy is actually a positive to the extent that it could be. That is, because **<u>David did not die as a cyberpsychopath, but as David Martinez</u>**.
