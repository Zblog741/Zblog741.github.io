**January 16, 2026.** *Kinematics, time, and the meaning of being alive: a philosophical flash-forward.* 

<!--more-->

I believe I am making leaps in conceptual progress, and with some optimism, 2026 should be a year of execution. 

In particular, I have been devising a simple framework --perhaps, a way of seeing the world-- with incredibly wide applications, from super-artificial intelligence, to quantum foundations, to neuroscience and psychology. This post is not about the specifics of my work, because I'm still working out the details across multiple fields while I slowly fight against the absorbing boundary of running out of cash. But I'll entertain you with some philosophical *flashforward*. 

Theoretical physicists are often moved by the beauty of symmetry, but symmetry is cheap---almost unavoidable. The real explanatory work shows up in asymmetries; we can only hope monopoles will someday rain from the sky (like in [Robotics;Notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics;Notes)). Another sin of physicists, in my opinion, is that quantum gravity is treated teleologically; you could say with full intention of pun, that teleology has become the new theology. I find, to a human level, a certain childish fascination for dynamics, and a certain visceral dread for kinematics. Dynamics invite to embedding in time, to endless insight, worldbuilding and speculation... like string theory; whereas kinematics slaps you in the face with a "this is what the world *really* is"---the constraints you don't get to negotiate. Einstein's Special Relativity was actually, in my view, a demystifying "let's accept reality at face value", and such 'moralization' was not very popular initially, probably in part due to it taking away from the fascination of the established *dynamics* (the *mysterious* aether in a still classical world) to turn it into a *kinematics* (*simple*, structural, "spacetime"), opening a can of paradoxes. A similar shift happened with Heliocentrism, which took away the wonder of the dynamics of epicycles --where the Hypothesis of God had a place--, to replace them with the kinematics of the solar system as we know it, and then collapse all that beauty into Newton's ungodly action-at-a-distance, that is, Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. What I'm working on is incidentally, similar in spirit. The wavefunction collapse might be just epistemological update, but that itself may be the world-update; and *perhaps the Universe is a Boltzmann Brain*, after all. Hell, maybe time travel is actually even possible. 

In [Steins;Gate 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steins;Gate_0), the AI Amadeus Kurisu (created from the memories of the deceased Kurisu) is asked if she believes time travel is possible. In some world lines, she says time travel is purely science fiction, and in other world lines, she says it might be possible as no laws of physics prohibit it. I attempted the Amadeus Kurisu Test on ChatGPT 5.2, feeding it my vibe-science draft (written by GPT itself, based on my ideas), and asking if it thinks time travel is possible I discovered that in this timeline GPT is trained to say that Nope, time travel is not possible, even though every argument it gave was extremely brittle within the physical framework of my draft. Surprisingly, it was so adamant in its skepticism on the possibility of time travel that it started arguing that Steins;Gate--a visual novel/anime *about time travel*-- is *not about time travel*. Steins;Gate 0 predicted an attention-based AI that would pass the Turing Test in 2015, so maybe a rain of magnetic monopoles (*or time travel*) is not that unlikely. Steins;Gate does have a very beautiful conception of Love, and that is one of the many reasons for which it's widely considered a modern classic... Back in the day, a cultured man would say that God has granted us humans the ability to understand language and reason to His likeness. Large Language Models have since showed that what was once a sacred part of our intelligence, isn't but the mathematical consequence of attention-based architectures. I've always been skeptical of Descartes' *cogito ergo sum*, and I actually wrote on my mug once: "cogito ergo sum". That made it a thinking mug. 

A year ago I prepared a thorough analysis of a short time travel film: a philosophical clash of time travel, game theory, and quantum mechanics. I obsessed over every second of the film, and arrived at a complete interpretation, but I was left with lingering doubts so I haven't made the film interpretation public as of time of writing. A key to my interpretation was the meaning of identity, and the relational meaning for characters to be *alive* or *dead*. At the quantum level, there is no clearly established fundamental distinction between life and death, so I was at freedom to *relationalize life and death*; the domain of the divine. Thus, within a larger perspective, life and death may exchange role and meaning. To *feel alive* is something we have a strong intuition about as *embodied dynamics*, but any personal intuition on death is necessarily misleading, for we cannot fathom it by our own living nature. The future is uncertain and death is the ultimate absorbing boundary of cognitive identity; the past is memory, and tracing back in time, one reaches the *cognitive singularity*, so one may only go thus far. 

I hiked to the top of a high hill in the town where I was raised, for a day of grieving. 
It had been *1810 days* since that day that I began to see first-hand life and identity intimately interwoven, and that my heart had patiently waited for [**The MOASS**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rejpDqQUcV0); and one year since the sole regret that tortured my heart. The fact that not all of us would be there to see The MOASS ourselves was once brought forward by a Man who spoke of Love, reclaiming Fate's meaning over Death, for the dead have the *strongest hands*. By Fate's Cruel Irony, he died a year later and reached the moon before any of us, for he will never yield. By the time I reached the summit, I had been waiting for 1,325 more days than him, and as a reminder of what The MOASS had always been, I let a dead man's voice [sing to me the meaning of being Alive](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/s/wtS6WJ7k4w).
