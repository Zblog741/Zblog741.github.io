**April 2, 2023.** *In this article I highlight the struggles of Albert Einstein shortly after graduating from the ETH, and mention how some of the greatest minds in physics have been at some point lured by a "promise of riches". I rely mostly on [Chapter 15 of Einstein for the 21st century](https://faculty.chemistry.harvard.edu/files/dudley-herschbach/files/einstein_student_new_0.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.*

I have personally been finding myself in a difficult situation upon graduating with a degree in physics. Objectively it could always be worse, but it is subjectively frustrating nonetheless. I remembered of Albert Einstein's strange backstory during and shortly after his studies at the ETH. A young man with a passion for physics and whose dislike for authority I could relate to, known for his annus mirabilis… Who came up with the theory of special relativity while working as a patent clerk? I noticed I had never really tried to put myself in his shoes, and believe that is most likely the case for most of us. I once read that people who would eventually become extremely successful tended to read biographies of other extremely successful people, and I don't know how much truth there may be in it, but as an aspiring theoretical physicist with seldom to no prospects, Einstein's story really piqued my interest. Graduated in 1900, special relativity and a series of other revolutionary papers in 1905, general relativity in 1915, Nobel prize and at the Institute for Advanced Study until his death. Some may mention he worked at a patent office during his doctorate, but his accomplishments seem to outshine too often in people's minds the details that built up to such results and the dire circumstances he had been in.

Einstein's interest in the ether predate his relativity from when he was in Gymnasium, and carried on during his undergrad years.

There are also many myths surrounding Einstein's grades on the internet. I don't think there is a doubt he was good at mathematics throughout his schooling. Although during his time at ETH he took laboratory courses instead of mathematics as optatives. He was indeed top quintile (for a lack of a better term; there were only 5 students) in the mid-degree oral exams, but he ended up in the fourth quintile of the final oral exams. I am still not clear on what caused the drop in his marks, and there is surviving a failing mark he was given in a laboratory class, but it is unclear to me how much weighting that really had on his final average. Apparently, things back then worked differently, so making comparisons to the current undergraduate marking paradigm where exams occur at least every semester is not a fair comparison at all, as there were only two sets of oral exams in four years of the degree at the ETH of the late 1890's.

Upon graduating, Albert Einstein was [objectively speaking] a f*cking loser. He was basically rejected from graduate school from everywhere he applied. Apparently, back then graduates going into academia applied to teaching postings, the modern equivalent of a TA, rather than the PhD program per se. I have read on the internet it was due to a subpar letter of reference by his diploma essay advisor, Weber, but all the evidence for it I could find is a letter by Einstein complaining his advisor played a dirty trick on him; some sources claim it that was due to being too critical of the science of authorities in physics of his time. Yet Einstein insisted on wanting to work with Weber during his doctorate, as his laboratories were excellently equipped. Which he started, in thermoelectricity, relying on his family's income. At the time he also worked on a paper and a presentation on capillarity he hoped would boost his chances of getting a teaching position.

Einstein was miserable during that time, since he **graduated in Summer 1900** and couldn't secure funding for graduate school. Allegedly back then it was easy to get a teaching position for a PhD; Einstein was the only one of those who passed that didn't get appointed as an assitant at ETH. And it turns out that the trope of needing a PhD (or in Einstein's case, a Nobel prize) to get into a PhD is not new!

  <figcaption>Einstein's father wrote to Ostwald. He wrote Einstein passed with flying colours, but he passed with a 4.9/6, which is probably a good grade, but not top of the class as previously mentioned.</figcaption>
</figure>

At this point Einstein had two options. He sticked to his boyhood dream, or he abandoned his dreams for a comfortable life with his wife. He chose the former.

Einstein took odd jobs as a tutor while in Zürich to help with living costs. He was also a tryhard trying to get his PhD thesis approved as soon as November 1901 (with no success). Eventually, good ol' <s>nepotism</s> networking landed him a job at the patent office in the city of Bern in June 1902. He moved to Bern in February 1902, interviewed in May, got the job in June.

</figure>

Contrary to what people are inclined to say, he did not consider his job at the patent office as an intellectual effort of the highest order ([perhaps with some exceptions](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdfplus/10.1086/448970){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}?). He was hired as a third class patent examiner, whereas other graduate engineers entered directly as second class examiners. He was earning good money because shortly It wasn't until after his annus mirabilis that he was promoted to second class.

*[Einstein described his time as an examiner in a letter](https://www.historyonthenet.com/albert-einstein-and-the-patent-office){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}: "I'm fine; I'm a venerable Swiss "Tintenscheißer" (ink shithead) with a decent salary. Besides I ride on my old mathematical-physical hobby-horse and scratch on the violin". In April 1906 he was promoted to "second class expert". His monthly salary increased to 375 Swiss francs.*

</figure>

In Bern he sook students he could tutor to make a living before getting hired at the patent office, but instead he made good friends over talking about physics and philosophy, founding *[Akademie Olympia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Olympia_Academy){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}*, a weekly meeting in which Einstein and two other friends read and discussed philosophy, with an emphasis on philosophy of science. As a patent examiner wagie, Einstein took advantage of having his own office and worked on physics when he could. As for how he managed it, I can only speculate he could work at his own pace, dedicating time to physics, and preparing work in advance, but I digress. During that time Einstein's father died and he later married Mileva.

Akademie Olympia was an important part of Einstein's rise to success, as they read [Science and Hypothesis](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/La_Science_et_l%27Hypoth%C3%A8se){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} by Poincaré, which treated the open problems in physics that Einstein would later solve. Einstein probably pondered over the topics covered by it for a long time, and developed the seed for his ideas from it (and from all the [Annalen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annalen_der_Physik){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} reading he was doing, of course). Immersion into philosophy can give rise to great ideas; similarly to how famous mathematicians like Erdős immersed themselves into their work. Perhaps it was that mix of philosophy and science what helped Einstein have his annus mirabilis. When Akademie Olympia was no more, upon the departure of one of the members in 1904, Einstein started going *hard* on physics. Lorentz and Poincaré had already laid the groundwork, which he must have been extremely familiar with. He had (almost) all the time and tranquility of the world as a patent examiner. The time he spent studying the physics and philosophy of physics which predate his theories was now time he could use to jump into action! Soon thereafter, he published 21 paper reviews, and a number of papers that would define his annus mirabilis papers.

## The more I read into the life of important physicists the more I find of their "regarded*" inclinations.

*<sub>NB: *Regard* or *regarded* is internet slang for a person who is willing to take extreme life-changing risks with or for money.</sub>

Going back in time when Einstein was a student at the ETH… **Something that really surprised me reading about Albert Einstein as a university student is that he likely considered at some point becoming the back-then equivalent of a quant** (*whatever that is supposed to mean*). All I have to back it up is this excerpt I found in [Chapter 15 of Einstein for the 21st century](https://faculty.chemistry.harvard.edu/files/dudley-herschbach/files/einstein_student_new_0.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}:

<figure style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/assets/einstein/image-12.png" alt="Einstein's finance courses">
  <figcaption>Einstein took multiple courses in finance during his time at the ETH</figcaption>
</figure>

"Banking and stock exchange, social consequences of free competition, statistics and personal insurance, and foundations of national economy"… Einstein had previously decided to stick to mathematics and physics, but his father's business went bankrupt in 1902. It is possible he saw the writing on the wall, hence he took those classes to improve his job prospects in case he needed it. Speaking from experience, these decisions of preparing for a plan B happen perhaps even unconsciously.

**When Einstein was miserable, pathetic, and unable to find funding for his research, he had the perfect opportunity to call quits to pursue a physicist's "promise of riches" in the financial sector.** Nowadays in England, that would be a quant. In the end however, Einstein remained true to his young self and never abandoned his plan A, even if it felt like that's what he was supposed to do.
When I was studying physics in my first year of university in England, I kept hearing about students who were excited about the prospect of a career as a quant. At the time I understood that meant to work for big money, and I thought that if most of the capable guys were aiming for that then the world must really be going to shit <sub><sup>(or at least the UK)</sup></sub>. As I mentioned in a previous post, I believe this is an ethical problem of the Information Age.

Note: on further reflection, I don't know to what extent Einstein tried to go into finance, or how realistic that would have been. 
If I were to speculate, he applied for the jobs and failed. The interesting tidbit is that in the end he didn't <em>decide</em> to build a career in finance (eg. by pursuing an unpaid internship), despite his evidenced interest. 

As to regarded great physicists, my sample is very small, but it indeed contains the greatest minds in the history of physics. Isaac Newton is a great if not the best example, and he is often attributed the following quote of dubious origin that allegedly appears in *The Intelligent Investor*:

<figure style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/assets/einstein/image-10.png" alt="Newton quote">
  <figcaption>"I can calculate the movement of stars, but not the madness of men".</figcaption>
</figure>

That is in reference to [Newton's investments in the South Sea Company](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.4521){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, which resulted in him losing most of the fortune he had accrued (being the Warden of the Royal Mint paid very well).

<figure style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/assets/einstein/image-9.png" alt="South Sea bubble chart">
</figure>

I would take some of the suggestions in the linked [Physics Today article](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.4521){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} that Newton simply fell for a ponzi scheme with a grain of salt or two. When it comes to the markets, there is a tendency to mark as irrational that which goes against time-tested wisdom and apparent common sense. I find this a troublesome sin of hindsight; the return of such speculative investments is extremely hard to predict, and what might now seem irrational and ill-informed may have been a hyper-rational bet with great risk/reward asymmetry but with limited information at the time. Investing is sort of like politics, there is not necessarily a right answer. In fact, I consider how some systems behave in this manner to be related to the concept of realism and the demarcation problem; I will talk about it in a future post, introducing some paradoxes that I would call Fermi paradoxes (generalizing this kind of paradox further than whether there is extraterrestrial life).

Nikola Tesla is another "regarded" physicist that lost his entire wealth to the promise of great riches, or perhaps as a consequence of need. He lost his tuition money to gambling, causing him to drop out of university and disappear from his family and friends in shame of his situation. Not much appears to be known about the details of why or how it happened.

<figure style="text-align: center;">

</figure>

And while it (probably) hasn't happened yet, if [the guy is brave enough to publicly pin a date](https://twitter.com/witten271/status/1611761523902353409){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, I can see Witten putting all his money into gold or bitcoin. Every true "regard" secretly hopes to be right once in a big way for the rest to think they come from the future.

I couldn't find anything about Feynman and finance in my extremely brief search (the Feynman-Kac formula doesn't count), but if it's of any use, I have a fun anecdote from when I spent a few days trying to synchronize background counting in my mind to a clock, as I carried on with regular life. I said to a friend, "it would be impressive if I could count seconds for hours to precision", to which he responded, "no, I would wonder why you wasted your time with that". In my defense, I would later learn that [Feynman tried it before](https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/607/2/Feynman.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.

Perhaps this risk-taking attitude is marked in great scientists, as long as it doesn't compromise the promise of great science — not only in what they decide to work on, but also to achieve so-needed funding. What would Newton have done with his newfound wealth if his trade had been successful? Would we have a Newton Foundation in modern England? Albert Einstein took rather [conservative decisions](https://einstein-website.de/en/what-happened-to-the-nobel-prize-money/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} for the wealth he acquired once he won the Nobel Prize, as that money was destined for his ex-wife and children; but before any of his fame he remained faithful to physics research against all odds, when he could, and may have considered to, pursue a career in which he wouldn't have had the opportunity to call his drawer at work the "Bureau of Theoretical Physics". At last I can say that I discovered I have more in common with Newton and Einstein than I previously thought: eagerness to risk money and getting rejected from everywhere I apply :p
