**March 13, 2023.** *Brief notes on the symbolism and philosophy of West Anderson's film "The French Dispatch".* 
<!--more-->

I found some old notes about West Anderson's film *The French Dispatch* which I wrote after watching it once, and just thought "why not post them?" I am assuming you've already watched the movie or are reading this in an attempt of convincing yourself to watch it. This is not meant to be a complete interpretation of the film or catch all references, but explains my interpretations after a first impression; it's a window into Wes Anderson's meme-world. 

I don't think these are the only ways to see it, but I think it's way better than what ChatGPT can generate me. I also liked this conclusion written up by ChatGPT: 
*Across the anthology, one shared symbolic element is the inversion of power and authorship. Prisoners become artists, teenagers become ideologues, chefs become heroes, and journalists move from observers to participants. This inversion suggests that truth and meaning often come from the margins, not the centers of power.* 

Wes Anderson, turns out he did philosophy at university. In these notes I interpret the three parts of the movie. And I got one of his philosophy references; I wonder just how many references to philosophy I must have missed in this movie. Overall, I find it to be mostly about loneliness, but also much more than that; about love. If we get speculative, I roughly see the stories represent three facets of love: in the form of feelings, in the form of the philosopher, and in the form of self-sacrifice. 

> Just watched The Frentch Dispatch. Went in blind and in one go. 

> I was rather confused at the beginning since I didn't know what to expect, there are many things I didn't understand (especially in the first part), and I was curious for the rest of the movie about the use of colours. 

> I first thought they were used only when the painting was on screen, but that wasn't right; maybe it was used only when there was a new experience. It was an amazing portrait of human interaction, the different layers of formality, and the lenses through which people view a same experiences. I was a bit confused when the woman the artist was painting arrested the artist, but in any case that scenario looked like a mirror, as if mirroring each other into the other (should watch it again). 

> Loved the tax evader. What is a tax evader doing in between a bunch of psycho murderers? It intentionally tries to shine light on the absurdities of the world. Loved when he asked for permission to talk in court, that he called it a "ritual", was denied, and he stepped into it and started talking regardless. The mouth washer was a clear reference to alcohol. "Finding a convict attractive" I think refers to the mirror attraction that arises on the other when one finds (as if convict of their feelings) the other attractive. The lady that was presenting the story then makes a reference to bdsm.
When the woman told the artist she didn't love him was painful, and when he said "I love you" was only the first part of what he was going to say (again, should watch it again). 

Clearly a reference to bondage; more specifically, emotional bondage.

> In any case he wanted to die because he couldn't paint (at the time I didn't make the connection but if I got the timing right it was most likely because she didn't love him, hence why he needed so much time). It was devastating to see her pull the lever, before pulling it up again; a clear reference that he loved her to the point of trusting her with his life. Knowing he wouldn't be able to paint again jolted him out of the chair, which I thought represented his mad love for his craft and by extension for that woman. 

This is really the sensibility in a man's romance: his love stems from what he is, not the other way around. 

> At the end of that part the artist did his work on a Fresco, and tax evader guy (hope I'm not confusing the characters, I'm not good with people and faces) loses his temper; it confuses the artist as he goes mad about how useless the artist is, which I felt was an analogy to falling out of love. Convincing that old lady that she should buy the art further drives the theme of the absurdity and 'blindness to life' that comes with age. The killing that ensues comes out of the folly of what they were doing, might represent the mental state of the artist. 

> [The artist] can't reach her, just like the ceiling that inspired him
> So the actual point of his art was that it would be unable to obtain, a fresco 

Yet people were there to buy his art. Perhaps, a reference of losing a relationship to someone else. 

> However things seemed good once again that what they felt and their reasons were evident again. The strange behaviour of the lady that was presenting this story is akin to that of someone who is calling for attention when she showed a picture of hers.

> For the manifesto part Wes ripped a part out of Phaedrus when the journalist is dinning with the family, though I was so focused on the similarities to Phaedrus that I didn't quite catch some of it. It does make me wonder how many more references like this there might be in the movie. The journalist crying at the beginning is a clear critique to ideas from modern day feminism and to pushing personal needs to the back in favour of one's career. When the journalist sleeps with the boy and he gets upset that she had let her mother know they were together that morning sets the difference between youth and maturity. 

Phaedrus is a Socratic dialogue about the meaning of (romantic/erotic) love, and through it Socrates makes analogies to sex and explains the nature of the soul. 
It's where the winged carriage thing comes from, people like misrepresenting it but itÂ´s actually about sex, depending on how you read it. 

> The movie seems to be making an analogy, this time about the passion of youth through politics and love. The young develop a sense of self who try to show it through politics. They were striking for the boys' right to access the girls' dormitory, and the girls were in favour of it; It sounds silly (another stab at the apparent absurdity), but it's as real as it gets. It probably does this to show how older people might see protests like these. The suicide of Mitch Mitch is something that hits close to home; the way the world forces some of us to act outside of our character can get to break us. We are made to think the chessboard is a symbol of strategy of the young protesters against the police, however I think this picture is incomplete. The girl is known to be most often than not in opposition to opinions of people of her same circle and ideology, and this probably draws from the (anti authoritarian) nature of the movement, rather to be expected among these circles. She complains about the Manifesto, and at some point she tells the guy that "his job is to play chess". How the turn tables, the chessboard is no more about the opposition to police :)

The chessboard is about the relationship between the girl and the boy. 

> Much of it is rather evident, like the lengthy minutes of the guy hugging the girl in the motorcycle after the woman tell them to go make love. 
> Yeah, when the protests erupt into altercation with the police, that's sex. Fireworks, they said ("the winged one" in Phaedrus). 

> The third story was probably more confusing, and I didn't get that much out of it. There were so many details that went over my head. The man who was narrating it, I loved him. "Let me bookmark the page", sounds like something a normal person would say. There was a bit of 4th wall break when they said maybe they were boring us, as the movie did feel, at least to me like batches of interesting things followed by boring pauses (and if you are not actively thinking you might get bored). The kid that was kidnapped, he was pretty smart. The moment he asks the woman who is nearby to see her eyes, that was profound, an exchange of true knowledge in a way. The chef that poisoned the kidnappers, he also lived for his craft. 

> When the narrator was asked why, and he went on to tell of his solitude in food, that hit deep home. I liked when the style changes to cartoon; we're seeing the world through the eyes of the kid who is living a new experience, as exciting as if it were out of a cartoon. The narrator says at the end about that other thing the chef said, describing the unique flavour the poisonous salts, and thinks it's not something that should be written while the editor thinks that's the best part... That also hit deep home. The chef had lived a long time without tasting something new; it's a reference to age. The poisonous salts, a reference to the feeling of liberty that suicide brings.
