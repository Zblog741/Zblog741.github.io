**March 1, 2023.**
*In this informal article I propose an anthropic argument for where advanced civilizations may be likely to dwell. I first discuss this argument in the context of the simulation hypothesis and then introductorily discuss the possibility of advanced civilizations dwelling near black holes.*

*Disclaimers: Paragraphs in italics is text I wrote years ago as a form of brainstorming. Part I contains the core philosophical motivation for the latter parts, which will focus on the science of the hypothesis.* <small> Furthermore, most of the post was written in 2023, but some details (extra clarity and power requirement calculations) were added in April 2025. </small>

## The Hypothesis

What I refer to as the Intergalactic TV (ITV) hypothesis is an idea I had inspired in previous rationalistic reflections in the intersection of epistemology, ethics and metaphysics. Some ideas and constructions preceding the Intergalactic TV hypothesis will be mentioned when considering the simulation hypothesis. In November 2020, I wrote (in my mother tongue):

  <p style="text-align: center;">
    <em>The highest social class in a world with a multitude of technologically developed civilizations would be the one that (i) can afford to live forever (with near-limitless freedom) and (ii) not miss an episode of their favorite TV show. 
    </em>
  </p>

These two ethical-anthropic postulates, living forever and not missing the weekly TV episode, make up the Intergalactic TV Hypothesis. The ideas of '**upper**' and '**lower**' worlds are to be understood such that postulate (ii) demands that any time spent in a 'lower' world should be negligible for an observer from the 'upper' world. Note also that in the stronger sense of the hypothesis, postulate (i) requires that the universe has infinite time (or equivalent resource) for such civilization to live forever. 

Note: The ITV hypothesis is a result of lengthy philosophical musings I wrote during 2018-2020, whose details I don't feel like publicly detailing until I'm a millionaire (since that would require me a few weeks of running my notes through a LLM). 
The "TV episode" you wouldn't want to miss is that of the higher world—lower worlds have mostly trashy TV shows, with some exceptions like *Steins;Gate* and *Tengen-Toppa, Gurren Lagann!*. 

## The universe as a simulation?

The idea of the ITV hypothesis was a consequence of some metaphysical reflections roughly summarized here.

*Starting with this Oxford philosopher [Nick Bostrom], we say that if we can create a simulation of a new world, it is most certain that we ourselves live in a simulation.* (See [Bostrom's simulation argument](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Simulation_hypothesis#/The_simulation_argument)). *I think that computational resources are a necessity to create any type of simulation. One of these resources is… Time!"* 

I consider an idea of proper time, which is associated with the generation of random or pseudo-random worlds (in a temporal-like order), from which the traditional idea of proper time in our world derives as (the) one that conserves coherence for the observer within the context of our world.

*There is this idea that the universe we live in may just be a very curious coincidence and that time is an illusion formed by what we call causality, which would be the correlations that allow us to experience the world from our perspective. That is, that there is no causality, but that we are only aware of a universe in which things seem to move and act in time as they do because it's the only way we maintain coherence between random universes. I'm pretty sure I've talked about this too. We carry a conscience that forms memories continuously. My point is that in between the snapshots of memory formation there may be countless other universes, some with their observers and their brains forming continuous memories from their perspectives.*

While this may seem an anthropocentric consideration at first glance, the role of the observer here is not necessarily more anthropic than in any other physical consideration that assumes a universe with definite facts. A more specific case of a process like the one described above is the simulation hypothesis, for which the causality of the simulated world is not but the coherence in time (to the judgement of who is running the simulation) of a series of worlds simulated in the higher world. The higher world would in appearance seem to generate countless other random worlds, as it is indeed the case that we can perform simulations concurrently, and that between the ticks of any computer simulation in human history there were all sorts of biological processes occurring.

*A simulation within a simulation will require more resources. We assume that for each simulation another simulation, or multiple new simulations, are most likely born, and a tree of simulations is made in this way. At the top of the tree there would be the "old" universe, and at the bottom would be our universe, along with all the other new generation of simulated universes. If resources like hardware are finite, time could be used as a (near) infinite resource. The computational requirements, ie. computing power and computing time, of younger universes is translated up to the older universes. Ultimately, the younger universes would function at a reduced time relative to older universes. This is evident in today's simulations, that out of an hour of computing we may simulate only a few milliseconds of some process.*

*However, this presents a problem. In the context of simulations and time as a resource, the youngest universes (the latest simulations) would be the upper worlds and the older universes would be the lower worlds*
(in the philosophical sense I gave to 'upper' and 'lower').
*For an alien who wants to travel to a lower world and live an entire life for five minutes of her upper world, there is no point in traveling to a world where living for an entire life means a thousand years in the original world. They would definitely miss their weekly TV episode. The Intergalactic TV hypothesis is not supported. That is, unless the aliens go to live in the latest simulations, thereby the youngest simulated universes taking the role of higher worlds.*

*This is quite surprising, and confusing. We must also assume that it is impossible for a single civilization control all simulations. I would certainly hope that they would be interested in meeting the other civilizations, but I don't see it possible to begin with, for logistical reasons, unless a [fetish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetishism) exists (i.e. an artificial object that can act as a beacon and interface between lower and higher worlds). Civilizations may have gone to live in different branches of the tree of simulations without knowing of each other, but in that case I would suspect intentional fetishes to have been left behind to indicate where to find such civilizations. I wonder, if there are simulations that can host intelligent civilizations in this world, would there be intentional fetishes? It certainly doesn't sound like this world, given that intergalactic travel is not practical due to the expansion of the universe. If there is such a thing intended for humanity to find it (eg. humanity is their simulation), I would expect that it should be somewhere in this galaxy.* Alternative to intentional fetishes, we can also talk about natural fetishes. They shall be those which can be found in nature, and from a rational analysis an expectation of finding advanced civilizations. The concept of this kind of fetish is extremely useful in the sense that if they exist then civilizations, by their own rational nature, are eventually drawn to them. In the next section, I speculatively propose that black holes can fulfill that role. 

Sean Carrol [argues](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2016/08/22/maybe-we-do-not-live-in-a-simulation-the-resolution-conundrum/) that there has to be a bottom to these simulations when the worlds across the tree are supposed to be similar when trying to argue the we *most certainly* are in a simulation, due to the need of computing power; a "loss of resolution". I do not see the need for that to be so if we assume there is a usable infinite resource that streams from a base world. If we express the universe and its history as having some information size we can only draw new universes with lower information size, but if the information size of our universe can increase then our universe can accommodate new universes with an information size similar to ours previous to the start of the new simulation. This requirement is transported "upwards", as previously mentioned. Obviously, this sounds like overkill, but it might as well be the natural evolution of intelligence.

## Time dilation to satisfy the hypothesis

The obvious clash that I see with our universe and the ITV hypothesis, is that the space where intelligent civilizations may be found is too big, and speed of causality in space is too slow. The Milky Way is about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">100,000 light years across</span>. The nearest large galaxy to ours, Andromeda, is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.5 million light years away</span>. And our galaxy group, the Local Group, is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">10 million light years in diameter</span>. The earliest humans appeared around 300,000 years ago. Technological evolution may suggest that by the time our light reaches the other side of the galaxy, humanity may be unrecognizable from today. The observable universe contains a very high number of galaxies, all at much more prohibitive distances than the length of our galaxy, accelerating away from each other due to the expansion of the universe. A civilization would then struggle having access to as many galaxies as possible (ie. intergalactic cable TV), without violating postulate (ii), assuming those distances cannot be reduced with worm holes or similar. If intelligent civilizations decide to shorten distances between each other, they can do so without violating postulate (ii), by using General Relativity in their favour. By dwelling near a black hole, a civilization can "wait" for other lower civilizations to approach, facilitating peaceful contact. They can also explore their galaxy for long periods of time but only sacrificing a small period of time at home, as the time dilation would in practice freeze home in time. Intergalactic travelling may also be possible in a similar manner. This approach also has its drawbacks: which black hole should be used? Galaxies outside of the Local Group would most likely be lost forever to inflation. 

Surveying for previous literature I found some of these ideas have already been approached, and dwelling near black holes allow multiple benefits from energy harvest, to using the black hole as a meeting point. I recommend reading [this article](https://www.universetoday.com/147546/beyond-fermis-paradox-xi-the-transcension-hypothesis/) from Universe Today. The Transcension Hypothesis is directly related to the ITV hypothesis. In fact, the Transcension Hypothesis, predates a number of my ideas, starting from the consideration that civilizations would go live in higher worlds. 

While John M. Smart argues for a "[STEM (Space, Time, Energy, and Matter/Mass) compression](http://www.accelerationwatch.com/mest.html#stemcompression)", the ITV hypothesis implies similar consequences from an ethical argumentation rather than extrapolation of technological efficiency. It is to be remarked that the very ideas of the advancement of civilization and of alien contact are actually, ethically framed. Without an ethical or anthropic assumption there is no need for civilizations to remain as such or make contact with other civilizations, leaving any extrapolations unsupported. 

For a black hole, there is also an assumption that our value and perception of time shall be at least similar to that of an advanced civilization. By the other side of the same coin, from the perspective of the advanced civilization, the time dilation caused by the black hole would cause the rest of the universe seem to be accelerated in time. It may be possible for such civilization to speed up their conscience too, matching the rest of the universe, ie. the coordinate time (in relation to the CMB). Smart also mentions there would be a stark difference between our perceived passing of time and that of advanced civilizations: we would be like plants from their perspective. Computers already completely outperform the human brain in far more than simple operations. For instance, state-of-the-art language model AIs can generate lenghty amounts of text instantaneously. 
The ITV hypothesis encodes this difference in the passing of time into the (meta)physics. 

## Black Holes as a Resolution to the Hypothesis

If the time taken to traverse the Milky Way, at a speed close to that of light, is to be equivalent to one year in the civilization near the black hole, that is a time dilation of 100,000 to 1. A civilization with a time dilation in this order of magnitude or greater is capable of travelling within the galaxy as if it was a short drive to Walmart. The radius of such a civilization can then be easily computed by setting the ratio of coordinate time to the proper time at the radius of the civilization; for orbiting observers, this factor blows up as we approach the photon sphere, and all such civilizations would be expected to dwell in a compact volume. 

For simplicity, I will start by considering non-rotating black holes, using the ol' reliable Schwarzschild metric.

<figure style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: center;">

<img src="/assets/aliens/image-1.png" alt="Schwarzschild metric" style="width:100%; max-width:300px;">
<figcaption>ol' reliable Schwarzschild metric, where $M$ is the mass of the black hole, $d\Omega^2 = d\theta^2 + sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2$, and $r_s = {2GM}/{c^2}$ is the Schwarzschild radius.</figcaption>
</div>

</figure>

To satisfy the ITV hypothesis, proper time $\tau$ of such civilization should occur at a much slower scale than coordinate time $t$ of the galaxy, i.e. $d\tau \ll dt$. 
Assuming hovering over the black hole at a fixed distance $d\Omega = dr = 0$, the proper time is related to coordinate time by

$$d\tau^2 = \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r}\right) dt^2.$$

The event horizon, at a distance from the center of the black hole equal to the Schwarzschild radius, is the minimal distance to the black hole from which the civilization would be able to communicate with the exterior, so the Schwarzschild radius poses a limit to the time dilation to be considered. This can easily be seen to correspond to infinite time dilation. For now, we'll make a mental note to return to compute the power required in this static fall case. It may be more interesting to instead consider configurations that do not continuously require of large amounts of energy; that is, orbits. 

The photon sphere orbit is the limit of the smallest free-fall orbit possible around a black hole, with a radius 
$r_{ps} = \frac{3}{2} r_s$. To mention, stable orbits for massive objects are not possible for radii this small, up to the Schwarzschild innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius $r_{ISCO} = 3\,r_s$. 

In the case of Schwarzschild orbits at fixed $r$ we have the metric 

$$d\tau^2 = \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r}\right) dt^2 + r^2 d\phi^2,$$

and it [can be shown](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/96498) that the time dilation $\gamma = \frac{dt}{d\tau}$ experienced by an observer in a circular orbit around the black hole is given by

$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{3GM}{rc^2}}}.$$

An orbit with radius nearing $r_{ps}$ will require of speeds nearing the speed of light, which would contribute for most of the time dilation, but to prevent from falling inward would require of constant energy use.
For an observer thrusting to hover at a distance very close to $r_{ps}$ from the black hole, we obtain that $dt = \sqrt{3}\, d\tau$, ie. most of the time dilation in the orbital case will be a consequence of the angular momentum. 
Clearly, the time dilation from just hovering over $r_{ps}$ alone is not enough for practical fulfillment of the ITV hypothesis, but if we use an orbit we can greatly reduce the amount of needed power: in the $\gamma\rightarrow\infty$ limit, the necessary power diverges $P\rightarrow\infty$ for the hovering case, whereas it converges $P\rightarrow P(r=\frac{3}{2}r_s)$ for arbitrarily large $\gamma$ in the orbit case.

<figcaption>The orbit must be very close to the photon sphere to really take advantage of time dilation. </figcaption>
</div>
</figure>


As a mathematical curiosity, we can and write $d\phi$ in terms of $dt$ so that the orbit solution looks like a hovering solution, and the photon sphere radius takes the role of the Schwarzschild radius: 

$$d\tau^2 = \left(1 - \frac{r_{ps}}{r}\right) d t^2 $$

Albeit unstable, an orbit close to the photon sphere may be considered a candidate for the requirement of minimizing continuous expenses of energy to counter the black hole's gravitational pull while trying to maximize time dilation. 
And though there is no stable orbit near the photon sphere, when considering the effective potential for an orbiting object, <a href="https://profoundphysics.com/black-hole-orbits/" target="_blank">it turns out</a> that in addition to the outer stable orbit there is an inner unstable orbit closer to $r_{ps}$. 



#### Power Requirements near the Photon Sphere

A civilization hovering near the photon sphere of a Schwarzschild black hole must apply continuous thrust to counteract gravity. 
Since the direction of this force is orthogonal to the momentum of an orbiting test particle, we can take the thrust needed to hover to be the same as the thrust needed in the orbit. 
The required proper acceleration is $a = \sqrt{3}\, c^4 / 9GM$, which leads to a power requirement per unit mass $P/m = \sqrt{3}\, c^5 / 9GM$. 
If this power comes from the civilization's own mass (assuming perfect mass-to-energy conversion), the rest mass decays exponentially, with a half-life 

$$
\tau_{1/2} = \frac{9 \ln 2 \cdot GM}{\sqrt{3}\, c^3}.
$$

For the mass of the *Milky Way*'s super massive black hole, Sagittarius A*, this is only about 76 seconds. Using one's own mass for thrust is not a viable long-term strategy, even with more massive black holes.

Suppose instead that energy is extracted from the black hole's mass. There are mechanisms to extract energy from rotating black holes, but assuming our super-civilization uses technology that extracts energy from non-rotating black holes, the black hole would lose mass at a rate $
\frac{dM}{d\tau} = -\sqrt{3}\, m \, c^3 / 9GM$, with corresponding half-life 

$$
\tau_{1/2} = \frac{9 G M^2}{4 \sqrt{3}\, m \, c^3}.
$$

Applying this to the mass of the *really* massive super massive black hole TON 618 (but without considering the rotation), with $M \approx 1.32 \times 10^{41} \, \text{kg}$, and setting $\tau_{1/2}$ to the age of the universe, $\sim 4.35 \times 10^{17}$ seconds, we find the maximum sustainable mass: 

$$
m \approx 1.29 \times 10^{29} \, \text{kg},
$$  

roughly *[twenty-one](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-happens-bitcoin-after-21-million-mined/)* thousand Earth masses. So, under some conditions, relatively compact civilizations could maintain stationkeeping just over the photon sphere over cosmological durations. However, black holes this massive are extremely rare, with most having maximum sustainable masses smaller than the mass of the Moon. 

Thus far we have considered non-rotating black holes. What about Kerr black holes? Would seem like Gurren-Lagann was spot-on about life advancing in constant revolution. That will make things more exciting. Furthermore, I'd like to argue the ITV hypothesis might be supported from an economic point of view, <em>when time is money</em>. I suggested the ITV hypothesis is about higher and lower worlds—and one way to see it is as higher and lower classes.
