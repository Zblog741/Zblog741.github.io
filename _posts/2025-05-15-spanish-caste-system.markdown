**May 15, 2025.** *Hereby I personally denounce the corruption of the Spanish institutions: from the way of teaching in school to the government officials directly responsible for the deaths of countless people.*
<!--more-->
*My position is that Spain is a corrupted state, **a failure of democracy**, a communist experiment and a symptom of decay of Western civilization; the Spanish "normal" is rotten. I warn that democracy in the current age is inherently different to that at any other point of history, and has devolved into what some call the charocracia. More broadly, I warn that the European Union must take responsibility for its political failures if the EU project is to be continued.* 

*Disclaimer: I will write based on my lived experience. I will not hide behind fear or undue respect: I will point at politicians for mass homicide by name, and will discredit Spanish institutions based on nothing but my truthful lived experience. This puts me at risk of retaliation and harassment.*

Waiting for the publishing of "*Spain has a solution*" by Iván Espinosa de los Monteros with conservative optimism, I am publicly stating my political position on this blogsite, which has come after enduring a constant stream of propaganda everywhere and anywhere I go in Spain. For context, I was raised across three countries in the Americas and Spain, and spent a large part of my years as a young adult in the United Kingdom; I'm also very into statistics. So I am not just stating opinions from a narrow worldview. An opinion of ChatGPT is that this post is inflammatory and unsubstantiated; this post shows negative emotion where it must, and remains unsubstantiated there where fact-checking is a basic exercise. 

Recommended track for this post read: [No Time For Caution by Hans Zimmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l3jadzn9cc&ab_channel=SHADYLULLABIES).

Let's start with the constant description that Spanish government officials, mainstream media, and people in private meetings, constantly give about people who hold opinions like mine: **I am a fascist, sexist, extreme far right ignorant and a liar**. Oh, and a climate change denier. That's your trigger warning. These are actually only the adjectives coming from government officials (I like watching the TV in the mornings), so they're the *kind* adjectives the Spanish Government uses for its law abiding, upstanding citizens. I am writing this post because I don't think theirs is an accurate description of myself at all, and the truth must be known, though you're free to interpret me however you want. For sources, you may ask a LLM. 

I have held this as my maximum: **I believe social truth is at the intersection between what we understand and agree with, with that which we don't *understand* or agree with**. 
If you disagree with my writing, I invite you to uphold that maximum too. This will be political, and pretty bleak. 
It does gets "brutally honest" at times. 
I am not here to propose solutions; I am not paid enough for that. Not that I'm paid at all. 
I urge you *not to* take wrong conclusions, but understand this as a societal warning. 

In this post I will talk about Politics, Education, Industry and Society in Spain. I will do so using a mix of personal experience, anecdotes, major events, and reflections. My personal anecdotes are rather biographical, so it might get mildly personal and entertaining. They are meant to be fun. 

Sometimes I will paste my *unhinged discord ramblings*, 

> just like this. 

This post is, after all, tagged with the unhinged category.

## Spanish Politics


First, let's mention that Spain is not one single nation: it is made up of a central government plus a system called the Autonomies (each with their own autonomic government), separating Spain by regions, many with their own language and culture, so the experience may vary significantly across geographies. 
Let's start by summarizing Spanish politics. This is an edited summary I once sent to a friend: 

> To fill you in with the Spanish political system, here in Spain we have a two party system (left leaning PSOE, right leaning PP), a number of minor regional-independence parties (who also happen to be communist in essence) who aim to partition Spain, a socialist party with strokes of communism (Sumar, a successor to Podemos), and recently a right wing Spanish nationalist party (Vox). The current president, Pedro Sánchez (PSOE) manages to remain as president by making alliances with the pro-independence regional parties and Sumar, despite PP having more votes than PSOE.

> The issue is Sanchez is becoming an authoritarian globalist, and has recently been constantly spewing populist lies. His policies are 100% directed at keeping the boomers voting for him, because Spain is mostly made up of boomers who only care about their houses and retirements with a huge portion of them completely believing everything Sanchez says. To make matters worse, PP (major right wing party) is literally the same but for people who vote right, even though they pretend it's not the case. I know very well because they all change their political stance to follow the votes. Usually the left generates populist noise for some progressive policy or stance, the government adapts that policy, and immediately the right leaning PP adopts the same progressive ideology. It usually backfires at them with undesired consequences, and the left (PSOE and others) dials down on that particular policy. Then PP does the same in their campaigning. That's how Spain keeps rotating its smaller communist parties without PSOE losing support. Besides, one of the separatist parties has links to "dissolved" terrorist group ETA, and Sanchez has been sucking their d*ck providing them funding and getting their terrorists out of jail earlier to keep their political support. They are tolerated, but Vox is demonised by mainstream media and leftists. 

> Sanchez has deliberately engineered big increases in the cost of living (despite having bashed against small increases in CoL when the right was in power), pretty much creating the problem and selling himself as the solution, and he does it all the time with every imaginable issue, from regional independentism to economic growth. For instance, Sanchez will let in more illegal immigrants, then he sells himself as the solution to the increase in sexual assaults caused by those same immigrants. PP is just a puppet of the same thing driving this country to suicide, and Sumar is completely unfit for government despite, in my opinion, their "good intentions" seem genuine. So we're left in a situation where the right wing Spain-nationalists are the only common sense in the political landscape. They are the only ones who don't jump on the bandwagon of every new political stance. They are the only party that stands for their beliefs. 

> But they can't win because they're too taboo. If people know you vote for them you're labeled a fascist and naturally shunned out of society. Besides, they hold 'radical' ideas like ending regional-independentism and the autonomies system. Sanchez (and the EU) is working hard at making people dependent on the government to do their own Soviet Union-like project, and they're winning because they make use of the incentives of **the decay**, accelerating it to their advantage. The truly fucked up thing is that people notice it, but they believe the odd things they notice in their daily life are just... normal, something everyone has to deal with. They shrug it off to how things are, or keep misplacing the blame at buzzwords like "capitalism". 

> Then they proceed to vote for a solution that only makes everything worse, better on paper, but a slow and prolonged attempt to end civilisation nonetheless. 

> AND they want me to eat pulverized bugs.

In further summary, Spain is heavily left-leaning, and the government is usually some coalition of left-wing PSOE with communist-regional separatist parties, while the right wing PP is actually the same as PSOE but for right-wing voters. 
They change their policies to please older voters and the progressive majority, since Spain is a country with an old, progressive population. PSOE has been in power since 2018 to date (2025) under leadership of Pedro Sanchez. Everything I will comment happened during Sanchez' leadership. 



## Spanish Education

Spain suffers the worst school drop-out rate in all of the EU, has among the highest grade repetition rates, and PISA performance is among the worst in the EU despite spending significantly more classroom hours than OECD average. Spain is also the most over-qualified country in the EU. 

Since 2008, Spanish universities have had started to have shortage of university spots. 
The result is we have a growingly competitive system where many students are left without the opportunity for higher education. 
Instead of regulating for higher education to be offered in proportion to strategic decisions and needs for the future of the country, we have this awkward system where you can be a philosophy major if you barely passed bachillerato (last two years of high school), yet studying mathematics is only possible for a small select percentage. 

After the mandatory secondary school, students are free to continue onto non mandatory education if they choose so. The baccalaureate is the more academic route; 
the offering also includes medium and superior degrees. Access to superior degrees is gatekept by the requirement of the baccalaureate or a medium degree. The truth of the matter is that medium degrees are more often than not, for the most part, a waste of time. If you decide after mandatory education (16 years old) you want to be a web developer, you are not allowed to take the relevant superior degree, but must either take baccalaureate (which might be too academic) or forced to do an unrelated medium degree in something like computer networks. Since baccalaureate is rather academic, the students who aim for it do it with the intention of also doing university. 

The disease of Spanish education shines in many ways, but one is my favorite examples is the "two major degrees". These are two-in-one bachelor's degrees, normally requiring about 360 ETCS credits. 
This is sold to the population as an increase in the education offering, as a "reward" to students and as a symbol of excellence. 
These degrees, however, are only a handful of places which do not increase university spots, and a logistic disgrace: they take five to six years to complete, without offering any real benefit other than the self-pleasing of the knowledge or degree hungry. 
While I am generally in favour of a more well rounded and interdisciplinary education, two-major degrees require mandatory courses from both degrees, wastefully inflating course requirements. 
The issue is seen even within single major degrees, which are often inflated with "mandatory courses" which often provide little to no value to the student's core education, personal interests or career development.

> The Spanish education is bloated, full of useless requirements. The higher ups can't imagine a world where they "lower the level" at any point of the education offering, leading to student failure, excessive grade repetition, and unnecessary *systemic arrogance*. The result is a system that glorifies memory and breadth at the expense of everything else, **even the success of the education per se**, led by the mentality of arrogant old-schooled academics. 

### Baccalaureate

I understand the US education system isn't perfect, and it might be vastly different depending on the district.
It's rather unexpected, or rare, to find someone praise the US K12 education system on the internet, but this is my experience: 

> I did spend one year doing high school in the US and honestly it's mostly what you make out of it. 

> I mean compared to Spain... in central systems like Spain they demand the same from every student more often than not

> that means a lot of unnecessary capping the potential of students and requiring students be good at subjects they don't really need or care about

> in the US the student has a lot more freedom to do what fits them best 

> that's also achieved by building big schools with relatively narrow focuses, as opposed to small schools that cover all schooling years

> it's no coincidence the US has so many top universities

> **when I did the science track of Spanish baccalaureate about 50% of my subjects were unrelated to STEM**

> and it seems they want to lower the STEM share in the science track even further...


I had spent my most important schooling years in Latin America, and then I had a one year stay in the United States. 
The US system was highly flexible and welcoming; even as an awkward teenager with broken English. 
During that year I greatly improved my English, learnt the basics of another foreign language, self-taught programming, learnt the basics of multiple subjects and found highly ambitious people I could work with. 
It was a hugely enriching experience, though I also saw a lot of frustration in the students who didn't see as much value. 

Upon coming back to Spain, I was a complete foreigner to the Spanish-Catalan education system, and as opposed to the welcoming and empowering environment I had found in the US, I found a hostile system that tried to get rid of me. 

> Our first trimester results were supposed to predict our expected final bachillerato results. I failed a number of my subjects and obtained, if I remember correctly, a barely passing grade. Of those that I failed, I failed mathematics with a 4, and for physics I can't remember whether I got a 4 or a 5.

The purpose of this first trimester was for the teachers to assess who would fail and who would pass Spanish baccalaureate. **A failing grade was a polite invitation to drop out.** I was one of those predicted to fail. Not really due to fault of the US system, but because I had just self taught an entire year's worth of math; I had a different background, which was especially weak in subjects like Spanish history or linguistics. It was expected for half of the students in the science track to either drop out or switch to the "easier" humanities track. 


<p style="text-align: center;"> 
<b>That was their normal.</b>
</p> 

> In mathematics, the failing grade in the first trimester showed my teacher I was expected to fail the course, given that around half of students either failed, dropped out, or moved to social science. However throughout the year I developed a liking and basic knowledge for mathematics, by hanging out on a certain questions and answers website, and reading daily about concepts in maths and physics, among others. 

In my first day of class, I enter to a silent room packed with some 30 students, and a teacher writing on the blackboard. I was made sit at the very back. Everyone in that room, without exception, was transcribing what the teacher wrote on the blackboard. 
There was no feedback other than the teacher repeating what she wrote on the board and everyone writing. She erased, and everyone moved page on their notebooks. Just a few minutes in, the teacher asked me why I wasn't copying like the rest. 
I replied I would love to but couldn't see as I didn't have my glasses yet, and I was moved further up front; in reality, I neither could see nor did I want to transcribe the blackboard. My handwriting was quite bad and slow. 
Two years later, that very teacher called me a genius, and it seemed I had acquired some of that reputation among teachers. Reminder: I was predicted to fail and was pretty much offered to drop out. 
Luckily, this particular teacher's teaching style changed; she seemed to be committed to challenging us, in a positive way, and liked to provoke our imagination in mathematics, by asking questions to the class to make us brainstorm. 

> I learned that Spain had cut off grades for getting into university, and that it had been constantly becoming more competitive to get a place for a decade already. 

In my second year, the math teacher was ascended to principal, and the new math teacher was a short-tempered engineer who made the students "drink the kool-aid" of the mathematics and accept facts over explanation, rather than derive intuition from first principles. This worked better for the students, who were only worried about obtaining the grades they needed to get into university. I believe I was the only dissatisfied student there, and surely the only one to speak up without a facade, akin to an *annoying gadfly*. It did lead to some complaints that escalated, and some minor changes to his teaching. I was perhaps somewhat of a controversial figure (but also a mysterious king of memes). 

Only about 15 to 20 students remained in my class. 
Your final average of the baccalaureate, plus a number of university entry exams (that are also biased towards subjects unrelated to STEM) determine who goes to university in Spain. 
For many university degrees, the system is highly competitive, and structured such that someone who excels in say, physics and mathematics, may never have the opportunity to do a degree in physics if they're bad at history, Spanish and physical education. 
That was, pretty much, my case. 
That is, unless they wait until becoming 25, since the system applies a different cut off grade from that age on. 

> I had a class called "science for the contemporary world" where a man would lecture us vaccines good and evolution truth. He once also made us watch a movie about a pharma conspiracy and asked who believed in that; most people raised their hand. Then he asked who believed in homeopathy and most raised their hand. The consensus was that homeopathy is medicine (it's not). 

When I was fifteen years old, I learnt programming on an old laptop I had, and had continued to use my phone to learn mathematics. 
Sometimes I used my phone in the mornings to read calculus or interesting mathematical theorems, but my teachers would often yell at me across the hallway to put it down. 
Teachers had a terrible disliking at students using phones in the hallways; they may have had power trips about it. It was often easier to use them during class. 
They demonized my means of learning. I didn't like taking notes. By leveraging technology, I had self-taught multiple programming languages, gotten into competitive programming, and learnt mathematics beyond the curriculum; I didn't like to just stand around while I waited for a teacher, so I would use my phone to learn. It was my means of learning and expanding my worldview. I didn't really take much from my teachers, for the most part. 
Now, soon teachers will be rendered as less effective than AI tutors. I believe that has the potential to free humanity into something greater if leveraged correctly. 

During history class, I heard about [Francesc Ferrer's Modern School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrer_movement) so I read his book in my free time. My opinion was that students from his school were brilliant, and that Spanish education was committing many of the mistakes in education he warned about, especially regarding the dogmatic and authoritarian approach schools had in his time. In other words, more than 100 years later, Spain was still committing the same mistakes. I did terrible in history, by the way. 

One regular academic year involved taking nine different subjects every year, all of them simultaneously. 
Instead of leveraging creativity and technology, the education system was very rigid and authoritarian, constantly punishing depth in favour of breadth, memorization and rote learning. 
This is an environment that punishes you if you're not able to take yourself to enjoy every one of those nine different subjects. In the UK, the equivalent is A levels, and they only take three or four a year. The US equivalent would be like two AP courses bundled into one, for each subject. 
Obviously, it is not realistic to cover the real depth that each of those nine subjects a year require. So, the vast majority of students only learns each subject to some relatively shallow depth. It's like being forced to eat. Moreover, meeting expectations was challenging when expectations were not clear: much of the marking were unsaid expectations about the student's responses, that the student had to magically be aware of. Their grade then depends on a function of that depth, being good at memorizing, punching numbers into a calculator (when relevant), and being a good exam prepper and taker. On a positive note, being bombarded with so many topics that doesn't cater the student's interest, there's a chance they'll discover something they didn't know they were interested in. 

> The thing I did admire the Spanish education system for was for giving an introduction to philosophy. The first few months were not very fun, but eventually we read lengthy extracts from a number of books including The Republic, and Beyond Good and Evil. I grew a liking for such classics and philosophy in general. However that didn't really show much in my grades as much of what we did was memorizing who thought what. 

Unfortunately, while the Spanish student is forced to take more subjects than reasonable, the student is not permitted to do so within their interests. 
There exists some leeway: science track and humanities track. Then within each track a couple subjects are elective (physics or biology?). But if you're in the science track you're not allowed to take Latin, or economics. However, you're forced to learn Spanish linguistics. That sort of thing.

Since the English I was taught was too basic for me and I was interested in learning German, after researching about it I found that schools were also required to offer other foreign languages besides English in the form of a remote course. 
So, starting in my second year of Baccalaureate I went to the admin office with the intention of requesting a change to take German instead of English, but was not given permission. 
I asked to talk with the higher up, and waited for perhaps half an hour in front of his office, during schedule the higher up was supposed to be in the office. 

> Then I found the man coming in, and my physics teacher who was with him 

> They didn't allow me to change subjects, giving frail excuses like telling me I have to take the university access English exam even though I was ready to take it without further attending English class

The possibility of taking a language remotely was required of the school, but it never appeared on any document they showed me; they never gave me any chance but to take English. 

> I complained to them about them not telling me of the possibility of taking German. 

> The admin man responsible for it starts completely ignoring me. 

> **I bring up they hadn't told me either about the (existence of) government grants for low income students.** I had missed out on that grant and my family really needed it. 
> My physics teacher defensively says I should have asked like (M) did, and starts accusing me. 

> I was aware (M) did ask about it, but by the time she did I was already aware of the grant, and that the deadline had already passed, **so (M) hadn't even received it, either**. 

> I was also irked at how badly they handled the graduation project requirement, not telling me about opportunities for research with actual academics, let alone the national contest whose deadline I missed due to not having a teacher willing to sign as my supervisor in time. 

> I was rightly indignated, and the admin man treats me rudely, kicking me out of the room. 


<p style="text-align: center;"> 
<b>That was their normal.</b>
</p> 

I believe, or hope, my school in particular seems to have changed a bit on that regard since then. 

If you could not adapt to their way of teaching, you were expected to find help from outside, so many classmates mentioned about attending cram school. 
One telling experience was when classmates struggled to do a dot product in physics class, but those very same classmates had already interiorized some integration result from math class. 
It made no sense to me, that they could understand the more complex reasoning behind integration without understanding dot products first. It was like the students were LLMs, "spicy autocomplete", except modern day LLMs have a better understanding of mathematics than that. 
It was explicit that the students were not there because they wanted to learn, but because they had to check the requirements to get into their desired degree. It was unrealistic for students to be simultaneously interested in 9 different subjects, where most are completely unrelated to their desired field of study. 
And the authoritarian style of teaching that promoted memorization over thinking skills, based mostly around transcribing blackboards into notebooks, clearly didn't actually fit everyone. 

> In school I met a girl named C. She was very nice to me. I didn't talk much to her, but she would occasionally to me. I would occasionally sleep on my school desk, especially as I didn't really talk much, and she would occasionally wake me up and cheer me up. She also wanted to study theoretical physics, but starting in our second year she had abandoned the idea saying she struggled with mathematics so she was being delusional. It hurt me to see her say that, and I really believed she could have done great and gone on to university to study physics. But I didn't say anything. Instead, she decided to pursue music and figure it out along the way.

I believe the most successful students were those who could convince themselves they loved each one of the nine different subjects, had perfect note taking skills with amazing handwriting and memory, and in the evenings and weekends did the in-depth studying. Relying on certain youtubers to understand the material was also a universal experience, even among the most successful students. 

In Barcelona, an extremely small number of schools serve as feeding houses to the most demanded degrees at local universities. 
The majority of olympiad participants come from the same school (school in singular; in my experience, informatics olympiad). 
The students believe the system is meritocratic and equalitary, and they rarely think of feeder schools as privilege because some of those schools offer scholarships. 
In reality, your teachers' and parents' background and familiarity with the system determines your possibilities. You won't find prepping for olympiads elsewhere. 
For instance, in my world, math or informatics olympiads did not exist until I arrived in the US and looked into what universities look for. These kinds of competitions (and to go above and beyond, in general) are viewed as a "wasteful" by many, since they don't affect your grade for a spot at a university; especially if math is only one of nine different subjects you must excel at. 
However, the local scene in Barcelona offers more possibilities to high school students than what an average university might offer to its undergrads; it's mostly a matter of whether your teachers have any awareness of those programs. 

### University

Seeing the writing on the wall, I ended up in the United Kingdom for my bachelor's degree. Years later, I returned to Spain for a master's degree, since Spain was cheaper. 

I arrived in Granada, a southern university city in Andalusia, with the hopes of retaking my interest in physics, trying to escape what seemed a hopeless and highly isolating situation. While my hopes were to minimize my cost of living, as Granada was known for being one of the cheapest cities in the country, I found the entire opposite: student flats were mostly for-profit companies that charged an entire minimum wage a month for a room, breakfast, and someone "to make your bed and do your laundry for you" (this is where the extra thousand euros in the price tag came in, I was told). 
The prominence of these kinds of student accommodation was a red flag I didn't understand until much later. 

I found that rent prices varied wildly for the same quality of housing. The price per room in a shared flat was based on the contract with the flat owner; so it was a situation where if you were friends with someone in the area that had a pre-existing contract, you could get a room for cheaper, perhaps 50% under market rate. 
I am not sure why this was, but I would suspect this was due to price controls forcing old long term contracts cheaper; or perhaps, result of price gouging by lessors targeting students on-season. 
If the students privileged with those contracts didn't favour you, you paid outsider prices which were similar to what you'd find in a large city like Barcelona, to some local owner. 

The city is an overrun tourist destination in spring, and felt like a "dusty desert" place for much of the year. 
Some parts of the city are very agreeable, even inspiring, to visit in spring or autumn, but to live there long term is a different experience: in Granada, the people are closed off and rude (they themselves recognize the locals are rude, calling it the "malafollá"). 
The sun is excessively orthogonal and gives you an orange tanning; if you're not careful, skin cancer. 


Despite physics and mathematics being some of the most in-demand bachelor's degrees, my class in mathematical physics had only about fifteen people, all of them local to Andalusia and from Andalusian universities, as far as I was aware; with only a couple exceptions from other parts of Spain or Latin America. Most lectures I had were in the main lecture hall: it had broken blinds, damp stains, you could see all the plumbing, and the student desks were extremely uncomfortable. The flooring and insides of my high school was rather ugly, but this was something else. 

<p style="text-align: center;"> 
<b>That was their normal.</b>
</p> 

I naively wanted to believe that the red flags I had found in baccalaureate would not be present in a postgraduate degree. Or that I would manage even if that was the case. 
My education in the UK was a very positive experience, with only some minor complaints and a desire the pandemic hadn't had so much relevance. *In Granada, I was back to transcribing blackboards into handwritten notebooks.*

And again that question, "why aren't you copying from the blackboard". Now imagine a professor looking like he should have retired a decade ago, writing on the blackboard for an hour and a half without break every day, mumbling unintelligible things to himself... 

> if it was a cute girl writing on the blackboard I would have endured, but this was torture 
> (theory of relativity, Albert Einstein)

I was told I was not the only one to fall asleep during the morning lecture every day. I am a human being, not a machine. Many times, the professors had no notes I could download, no slides or handouts, so it was impossible to follow the class. 
If I missed what they mumbled to themselves, I had no context about the squiggly symbols on the blackboard. And when there were notes or slides, it was a miracle if they were typed and a double miracle if they were not anti-intuitive. 
YOU were supposed to make the course notes. *This is how most professors did it*. For every semester course subject, of which we took eight apart from the dissertation, most often than not there were *three* professors. 
The continuity of the content felt fractioned; one day it's a physicist, the other it's a mathematician who writes in a completely different language and literally growls at you when you don't look like you're paying attention. 
When the lecturer was a foreigner I felt relief; they did a better job. Not all the professors were terrible at teaching, but most were either terrible or rude. 

Professors marked attendance, and just that could make the difference between passing or not. Now, I couldn't even tell myself I'd just read textbooks in my bedroom, because of attendance; and seldom no professor followed the order of any textbook. I was forced to sit still, forced to listen to old men  mumble things to themselves, forced to write down shit I didn't even understand, to toss it later into the bin because my handwriting is illegible, just to keep appearances!
For I wouldn't want to have an old man yelling at me. I couldn't see, I couldn't hear, and it all felt like a big elaborate joke. I was supposed to do that every day! 
Needless to say, I didn't succeed in that environment. Interestingly, my Andalusian classmates did. 

<p style="text-align: center;"> 
<b>That was their normal.</b>
</p> 

In one occassion, during a lecture, I drew my phone out to open the wikipedia article to something the professor had just mentioned, and the professor immediately began to yell at me, with a very angry expression. 
When I was studying in Granada, my experience was to be yelled and growled at. 
Some professors were insightful and some nice and thoughtful, but the bore-to-death, authoritative and threatening environment you'd expect from the classroom of a movie based in the 1900's was there. 

<p style="text-align: center;"> 
<b>In Spain, your autonomy is not respected as a young adult.</b>
</p> 


The overall rudeness, authoritative delusion, intimidating tones and yelling was one of the reasons why I was nearly turned away from physics altogether. 

Within the first few weeks starting the masters' degree I scheduled a chat with a professor to discuss working under his supervision for my dissertation. 
His posture and general disinterest in his words gave me a rather extreme impression of arrogance, but I tried to keep an open mind throughout the conversation. 
He asked me about my background and I answered. 

> I couldn't but compare it with the friendliness and politeness of my professors back in England

He asks, as if trying to confirm, that I went to Cambridge. I had clearly told him where I went to, a Rusell Group pronounced very differently to Cambridge, and I wasn't sure if he was trying to diminish my background. 
He then tells me he gets very busy, suggesting if I don't hurry finding a topic for the dissertation he will get busy with other people, but then tells me to take my time and not to hurry; it was as if he was telling me not to hurry so he didn't have to be my supervisor. 
I brought up my interest in some of the topics he had researched and his response was a brief "I don't feel like it". 
Apparently he allegedly wanted to do something different that year. He waited for me to talk all the time, as if forcing me to lead the conversation or was trying to make me uncomfortable. 

Some time later, I chatting with a different professor (let's call him A) and another student. Professor A mentioned that the professor I had had that chat with had been saying he was so popular for dissertation supervision that he had to shoo students away like flies. 

> honestly when i was in granada i thought the world would be a better place if 70% of the professors there were fired 

> those old fucks living off the taxes my family and the country pays and treating me like shit

> and fuck god save academics in this country from getting their heads so up their arse they become ouroboros

> how narcissistic do u have to be to inflate ur own ego from the misery of other people?

> the worst is that academia itself, the big driving force is ego way too often

Professor A also mentioned he (A) had written and submitted a paper about a theory he (A) didn't believe was true, but the journal accepted it; I honestly laughed with him because A was genuinely lighthearted. 
But I remind you, these are your taxes. 

It took me some time to understand that here, grades were determined by the professor, and then the professor came up with the reasoning for their grades, rather than the other way around. 
They had it all upside down compared to how it was done in the UK, where the grading criteria were clear and transparent, grading was mostly anonymous, and exam marks were expected to have a mean around 60. I heard that in Granada 80% of students have to fail a subject before a professor was scrutinized. 
I once had the pleasure of chatting with a girl in Barcelona who coincidentally also studied in Granada, and told me that a professor once used the colour of the t-shirt students were wearing that day to determine their grade (I am not making this up!). 

Another experience I had was more nuanced, but piercing through appearances, showed me the lack of scientific integrity of the people at the institution I was attending. 
For unexpected reasons, I missed a presentation I had scheduled, and asked to reschedule it, knowing I had the right to as per university stipulations; the professor showed no problem. 
One of my classmates sent on the group chat a paragraph-long text demanding me to apologise for what amounted to inadvertently making them wait five minutes (I was not the only person scheduled to talk). 
She was basically asking me to beg them to attend my rescheduled presentation, saying they were making me a "personal favour"; I replied with righteous indignation that they were not doing me a personal favour, and that they were free to either attend or not my rescheduled presentation. 
This interaction is what the professor later used to give me a grade for the presentation, the worst grade she had ever given. 

> This professor too, became somewhat verbally abusive because I used to use my phone during lectures and I made a question ("corrected her" according to her) on something saying I had just read it on the Internet 

> she made a comment along the lines that phones are not allowed. 

> So I didn't use my phone the following lectures and made a question about something that confused me

> and I felt it was kinda rude her telling me to look it up online

> she was making comments like "I can't tell if you're looking it up or chatting with your mom or your girlfriend".

> I really didn't enjoy the comment since I had recently gone through very hard stuff with a loved one 

The presentation was rescheduled, and I gave it starting by thanking people for showing up. The professor gave me a grade 3.7 standard distributions under the mean (apparently the lowest she'd ever given in her life). When I went to discuss it in her office and asked about the grade, she started making up bullshit reasonings for the low grade, such as doubting my right to reschedule the presentation, saying I didn't learn anything about my presentation (she didn't even understand the topic), and *starting by asking if I apologized to my classmates*. 
How could that be related at all to the quality of my presentation? Clearly the idea that I must have apologized, when I had already publicly thanked those who showed up, seemed very odd considering that initially she didn't show any issues with the reschedule. That is, unless the girl who demanded an apology from me showed the professor I wasn't willing to play her game and apologize, suggesting some sort of revenge. 
The professor eventually also brought up my presentation was not very clear, which was a genuine point to make; I believe this was only used as a means to the grade she had already decided, considering her generosity with some of the other presentations. I had other similar grading experiences, but they were not as evident as this one. 

> the professor also brought up I'd have to find a first job and do interviews 

> I said nothing. 

I had already applied to three thousand jobs and worked for nearly a year and a couple summers. 
I was there *after* quitting a comfortable job. 

> She was an academic. She had never had to send a job application. 
> And from a previous age, when anyone could become an academic if they chose. 

> maybe it's her who needs a first job 

After tweaking my presentation I was eventually given a decent grade. The professor made me some personal questions. 
Every exchange with her was as if she was aiming to make me lose temper and prove I was an arrogant prick, but I just nodded along until she recognized my work and asked me why not try a PhD in the field. 
The better grade she eventually gave me was not even remotely enough to get funding; I said I wanted to do other things. I'd just given up. Enough stuff to deal with in real life. 
*She will live off my and my family's taxes, I will most likely never get funding for my research.* Even if I did, I wouldn't want that sort of environment. 


#### Notes on Petty Crime

The gyms in Granada overflow with young guys; 
I once left my phone on the ground for a few seconds as I finished an exercise, and immediately two teenagers were already murmuring, in trashy character, about stealing it. On another occassion, my phone had broken and I had no access to internet or calls, so my parents ordered a replacement phone to arrive by mail. It seems it was "delivered" just inside the building but outside my flat's door, where it seems stayed for ten or twenty minutes as I returned from buying groceries or some lecture; it was stolen. I am not talking about someone *in need* stealing a phone, I'm talking about young adults, for whom either their parents or the central government already paid for their rent and living expenses. At the slightest chance, they didn't bat an eye before attempting to commit a petty crime like stealing something that my family struggled very much to pay for. 

Furthermore, I never expected to write and post this but I was sexually harassed. Not in an exciting way some may imagine, but in the way that you're forced to do something for which you may be falsely accused; hell, might have even gotten expelled and ended up in jail. 
This experience was extremely unwelcoming, as I was attending dance class to work on my shyness, and stopped going as a result of this experience. 
I was paired with a woman for some basic salsa, and she tried to force my hand onto her breast, in front of everyone, without any warning or consent of any kind; I didn't even know her or had spoken with her whatsoever. 
In the surprise of the moment, I was confused about her intentions. I countered her force away from her, and hadn't I acted then she could have accused me of sexual assault without leaving any credibility to my defense. 
While impossible to know her intentions, that was definitely not the way to make an advance, but surely an easy way to produce a false accusation and get all those state benefits at the cost of my peace and criminal record. 

## Feminist Spain

Let's see what's behind the veil, shall we?

[There is a video](https://x.com/WillyTolerdoo/status/1884594439663849662) where we can see founder of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, in 2025 saying his failure was not being able to convince Sanchez that they had to make Spain into a republic and transform (seize) judicial power and media because they (leftist politicians and media) will all be executed (by the "far right"). 
In other words, he was calling to end the separation of powers and hold media as an arm of the state; which honestly sounds a lot more like dictatorship than democracy, to me. 

Podemos is a political party that used to be seen as the next alternative to PP/PSOE bipartidism. It heavily advocated for feminism, led by Pablo Iglesias and his wife Irene Montero. 
The identity of Podemos was based around the "theory of Patriarchy", where every piece of data was reinterpreted so that any evil was "caused by patriarchy". This period (think 2015-2020) led to the rise of official Gender Studies degrees in Spain and an advance in communist ideology in student populations. 
Multiple massive strikes were organized every year where they chanted against patriarchy, where hatred was normalized and some even called to "kill" men (kill the macho, kill the oppressor, etc). It was similar to *1984* by Orwell, as in the "two minutes of hate". 

Many feminists argued they were not extremists, blaming "misandrists" for any bad behaviour; I don't think there were as many misandrists as they thought, feminists simply acquired that function from time to time. Disagreeing with their views and interpretations of data or reality was social suicide. 
Around 2018, I was taking a beginners' German course for adults in Barcelona. 
I never interacted much with the people there, and when I did I was always respectful, but I have this memory when during an innocent conversation session some girls (in their twenties) started to openly trash men in their broken German, saying in front of me without shame "all men are trash and pigs", and the teacher joined them and laughed with them. 


<p style="text-align: center;"> 
<b>That was their normal.</b>
</p> 

> I keep asking a feminist version of ChatGPT her opinion of my writing and it keeps telling me feminism is not about this or about that. **What is it, then, the Ship of Theseus?**

Other socialist strikes were also organized frequently: in Catalonia we had the separatist process and referendum, and another common one were students demanding for free education. The funny thing is, education was already free for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. It was also inexpensive for students whose families could afford it. 
However, no one organized strikes for the students who could not afford to pay rent at a commutable distance from a university, and the government did not offer sufficient help for that. 

I will not mention on the issues of feminism, as I believe much of the polarization we see in the world traces back to a deeper collective problem (by the way, "capitalism" is just the new "patriarchy"), but a strong populist party like Podemos leveraged emotion over facts. 
And it was biased, against men. After their policies were adopted by PSOE, instead of increasing equality between and women, metrics of inequality increased. 
Turns out, the rapists and molesters were not really that often the Spanish men they had spent years hating on, but immigrants mostly from underdeveloped countries that the government kept importing. This can be easily fact-checked in so many ways, that I will simply not. In fact, Spain used to be one of the safest countries on earth for women, and it wasn't until the feminists were in power that it started going to worse. It took until the pandemic for the self-feeding narrative of 
`problem --> strikes for leftist policies --> leftist policies implemented --> leftist policies cause worse problems -->  larger strikes for more leftist policies` to slow down. 

> i'm an immigrant too, and where I come from people kill you for twenty dollars

This is what a female friend has let me know after living abroad for many years: upon returning to Spain, she didn't feel safe anymore because of all the unpolite immigrants, and misses what Spain and her native city used to be like. 
The (PSOE) government in fact freed or reduced the sentence of more than a thousand rapists from prison earlier than they were scheduled to be released with their legislative changes to sexual assault. 
Moreover, the Spanish constitution now thoroughly discriminates based on sex even though you can just change your declared sex, and patriarchy theory is incorporated into the system in the form of gendered legislation. 

However, not all is negative! Podemos leadership greatly enriched themselves, and they still denounce sexual violence (as long as it's not committed by immigrants). 
The government [still proudly keeps their misandrist rhetorics when it comes to issues such as male suicides](https://x.com/wallstwolverine/status/1890387385482916266). 

<p style="text-align: center;"> 
<b>The result of feminist Podemos was the death of thousands of people.</b>
</p> 

Nobody went to prison. This is the unspoken truth about where the inflammatory Spanish feminist movement led to: they ignored EU and expert recommendations to stay home on March 8, 2020, as precaution because of the covid pandemic, and prioritized having an ever-larger strike. 
In fact, the government encouraged women to go out to the strikes. 
That day, *millions* of women went out to the street for the largest feminist strike in Spanish history; these crowds were surely the largest, densest and most omnipresent in the history of the country. 
Estimates say it was more than 5 million women. 
The lockdown was imposed just six days later, on 14 March 2020. 
The consequence was that the feminist strike became the means of contagion for the first and largest wave of the covid in Spain, which caused thousands of deaths during the following weeks, leading to a total of the than *one hundred thousand deaths* to covid. 
Spain was indeed one of the countries hit the quickest and the worst by the pandemic in the world. 

> it's all patriarchy theory, with patriarchy theory they can just wave their hands and turn whatever i say into whatever they want

> I'm like: your movement killed thousands of people

> feminist LLM is like: no, you're horrible

If you check [the Wikipedia page](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Cronolog%C3%ADa_de_la_pandemia_de_COVID-19_en_Espa%C3%B1a) of the pandemic timeline in Spain, they track down every single death classed as gender violence that happened during the pandemic, but there is no mention about the March 8 strike or its importance in the contagion, except for one picture and its caption. 

The feminists didn't improve anything in the long term (as long as I am aware, that is quantifiable), but they profoundly fractured the collective subconscious across gender, and created new taxpayer-funded sources of income for communist-feminist lobbyists and institutions. 

> feminist GPT keeps telling me I'm wrong about everything (i'm not) GASLIGHTER

## Disaster Spain

Spain has faced several disasters this decade, and in every one of them the central Government has acted in a completely negligent form. 
A repeating of inaptitude, of stupid decision after stupid decision *in the name of "progress"*, causing thousands of deaths as result of "unintended effects" and negligence reminds me of something I've read about before: Soviet and Chinese communism, and their inaptitude *leading to famines that killed tens of millions of people*. 

### The Covid Reckless Mass Homicide

In the early days of the covid pandemic, when the virus was being studied for its high contagion rates, the central government decided to do what Spaniards seem to be surprisingly good at doing:
homicide by negligence. The Minister of Health called covid a "little flu" when other countries had already started giving recommendations and taking measures. 
Then, as I mentioned in a previous section, the feminist movement encouraged by politicians and the government created the perfect environment for the first wave of the contagion. Over 100k people died as consequence of inaptitude. 
I won't go on about this section since I wasn't in Spain during the most relevant points. 

### The DANA Mass Homicide

I will call it for what it was: mass homicide by negligence (genocide at worst). 
On 29 October 2024 Spain suffered massive flash floods, particularly in the city of Valencia, which resulted in more than 200 deaths in Valencia alone. 
The morning after, the government didn't gave a fuck. Actually, the people in power such as SUMAR leader Yolanda Diaz (third in chain of power) [was discussing patriarchy](https://x.com/WillyTolerdoo/status/1851559834136592769) as usual. Clearly, they slept very well that night. 
In the aftermath, SUMAR leader Diaz appeared on a photography from a tweet posted by a government official which was later deleted, and some of her notes could be [visible with some zooming in](https://x.com/herqles_es/status/1853836070028218708). Her notes, five days after the tragedy, said "**This is our moment!**" and "**climate [change] denial = kills**". It looks more like they were taking notes on a narrative, than on helping the people whose homes were replaced by mud and may be grieving a loss. 

<p style="text-align: center;"> 
<b>That was their normal.</b>
</p> 

The devastation of this disaster was comparable to a tsunami. If it wasn't for the channels built during Franco's dictatorship, thousands or tens of thousands of people would have died. 
There were further hydrological plans to prevent this sort of disaster but were scrapped by the government back in 2005. 

> Spain is lagging in infrastructure that governments ought to provide, and yet i have no job. 

> I actually predicted back in ~2018 something like the Valencia floods catastrophe could happen, because these fuckers were like 30 years behind in their warning tech compared to the US, and yet i have no job

> instead they give citizenship to hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens who will be a net negative to the economy over time

Spain’s leaders Pedro Sánchez (PSOE), Carlos Mazón (PP), and Margarita Robles (Defense Minister), held the power to act, with the central government legally able to override Valencia’s delays under Spain’s constitution. Instead, they deflected blame, rejected aid, ignored warnings, and left volunteers as the only responders for nearly three days. Their negligence, rooted in political maneuvering and cultural apathy, turned a natural disaster into a human tragedy, with X posts decrying their inaction.

<p style="text-align: center;"> 
<b>This timeline is part of a narrative. Declaring a state of emergency was most likely not even a necessity. </b>
</p> 

So, neither Sanchez, nor Mazon, nor Robles acted in time. UME Chief Francisco Javier Marcos didn't act either, [supposedly because they needed authorization](https://www.eldebate.com/espana/defensa/20241119/def1602019-orden-autoriza-ume-actuar-emergencia-antes-activacion-formal_245984.html) to deploy into the area. [Actually, the Spanish government was literally faster sending humanitarian aid to Morocco than with the DANA floods.](https://x.com/infovlogger36/status/1852406518873756105) 
I suspect UME Chief's actions might have been based on a bad interpretation of the law, and [Artice 4.2](https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2019-2441) only means to limit the power of UME before a disaster, not after (emphasis in necessary). I mean, imagine there was a catastrophic disaster and there was no one to give authorization: how fucking *dumb or evil* do you have to be to just let people die because there's no one to give the dumbfucking authorization? 
And this was very clearly *already* a national emergency, not only competence of the Valencian government; even if the law was this evil, the decision of not elevating the emergency to level 3 (state of alarm) was purely political. If no one ends up in jail, some judge needs to commit seppuku. Because the hundreds of people that died in Valencia need not have died, and at every step of the process to help them some politician *left them to die*. I demand actual justice. 
Let's look into it:

#### Could Margarita Robles (Minister of Defense) send help directly, or did she need Sánchez to declare an emergency?

> Yes, Margarita Robles could deploy the UME (Military Emergencies Unit) without needing Sánchez to declare a state of emergency.

- The UME is under the direct authority of the Minister of Defense and has a permanent mandate to operate across the national territory in emergencies ([Art. 2, Orden DEF/160/2019](https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2019-2441)).
- In urgent situations, the UME Chief can order intervention immediately and notify the Minister afterward ([Art. 4.3](https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2019-2441)).
- The UME can also act in response to requests from other public administrations, if so ordered by the Minister ([Art. 4.4](https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2019-2441)).

#### Did Sánchez need to declare a state of emergency for help to arrive?

> No, a formal "estado de emergencia" (state of alarm) is not required for emergency aid or military assistance like UME deployment.

- The Prime Minister can declare a state of alarm under [Ley Orgánica 4/1981](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1981-12774). 
- The UME's emergency responses are governed by civil protection and military coordination laws, not constitutional emergency powers. These are “operations contributing to the action of the state” and do not require special declarations ([Art. 4.5](https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2019-2441)).

#### Is UME authorized to operate across autonomous communities without their permission?

> Yes, UME is authorized to operate throughout Spain, including all autonomous communities, without needing prior approval from regional governments.

- UME's jurisdiction explicitly includes “any place in national territory” ([Preamble & Art. 2](https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2019-2441)).
- Its deployment is decided centrally through the Ministry of Defense, with support from other parts of the Armed Forces if needed ([Art. 4.6](https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2019-2441)).

For some time, some speculated the government might attempt to cover up the real number of deceased from the floods, but thankfully I now deem that extremely unlikely. 
Turns out, the speculation was [sparked by mainstream media](https://x.com/GabrielAraujoES/status/1854894509634523136).
And [mainstream media called the people who showed up to help in Valencia **neonazis**](https://x.com/alonso_dm/status/1852842558939893954). 
President Sanchez did eventually appear in the scene of the disaster, but not without making sure he was well [accompanied by about a hundred Madrid police units](https://x.com/Albertopugilat/status/1853006351661666372). 

#### The Public Opinion 

In conversation with a family acquaintance, a professor or university lecturer of some kind in historical architecture, what society typically considers "cultured", the topic of the flood came up, since it was recent news. 
I think the brief conversation I had represents a huge chunk of what makes up this country; probably the narrative PSOE and SUMAR aimed for. 
He declared he didn't like Sanchez (like everyone does, yet he's president), but that if Sanchez had sent UME troops to Valencia he would have been demonized by the right and would be accused of a coup d'etat. 
He brought the context of the events that happened during Catalonia's secession attempt, where state of emergency was declared to prevent the referendum. 
According to the professor, Sanchez "couldn't do anything" because if he did he would be "accused of dictatorship by the far right". 
I pointed that the Valencia government was clearly incompetent at handling the situation, and the central government should have acted to save lives, since saving lives was more important than political speculation; instead, the central government left Valencians to die. The professor reluctantly agreed Sanchez was also in the wrong, and then he seemed to shift guilt towards the "*anti-intellectual*", "*climate change deniers*" in the Valencia government, citing that Valencia president Mazon was the top responsible, *together with Vox* (aka. the "far right", who didn't have anything to do but shared the Valencia government with PP/Mazon), citing they had just cut funding to regional emergency services. I researched what he mentioned, and turned out Vox had scrapped plans to a phantom emergencies agency with no offices, staff or resources, but that offered a generous salary for a political position, on the basis that UME and local firefighters already had that role. The self convincing is strong. His reasoning was bullshit: all built on counterfactual narratives. The socialist Spaniard first decides their opinion, and only later comes up with the reasoning for it. 


<p style="text-align: center;"> 
<b>That was their normal.</b>
</p> 

Simultaneously, the disliking for Sanchez from right-wing citizens is the highest it's ever been, with chants of "Pedro Sanchez Hijo De Puta" appearing spontaneously in all sorts of events. Ever since the Valencia floods, it's become a bit more socially acceptable to openly disagree with current government policies. 


### The Great Blackout

On Monday 28 April 2025, around 12:33, there was a power cut that affected the entire Iberian Peninsula. 
The entire country had no power. People communicated by word of mouth, and that's how everyone remained updated; it was chaotic because the information relied was not always truthful. 
The causes of the blackout were unknown. Mobile data didn't work either. The sun set down, and no power; police cars were deployed everywhere to keep order. The grid was restored deep into the night, around 4am. 

> no data for the entire day and then at night it was like having just a few bits of data every 30 minutes 

The cause of the blackout is unknown to date, but apparently originated in Spain. There were [fluctuations in the frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Iberian_Peninsula_blackout), but not much more is known. In the previous years, [the government has been demolishing nuclear plants](https://x.com/ada_lluch/status/1916961580790779924), and moving mainly to solar energy sources, even at the expense of seizing lands used for agriculture to build large-scale solar photovoltaic plants. 
Solar, which lacks mechanical inertia that comes useful to stabilize the grid, made up 59% of the supply at the moment of the blackout. 
For this reason, the frequency fluctuations point towards an overreliance on solar as a possible explanation for the blackout. 
The "far-right" pointed this out, which the government didn't like. 

> President goes on TV to say I'm ignorant or a liar because nuclear plants are a problem, not a solution

> i am a far right radical because i dont think demolition of nuclear plants is a good idea, "a blackout would NEVER happen in Spain"

[Sanchez had said there wouldn't be blackouts in Spain, calling it a far-right fantasy](https://x.com/MurcianoJapo/status/1916847412422811936); so did [other left-wing politicians](https://x.com/vitoquiles/status/1922624196175134789). After the blackout, [Sanchez stated nuclear were a problem during the crisis (!?)](https://x.com/rtvenoticias/status/1917174795982032899) because they "consumed energy while they attempted to recover the grid", which is [not true](https://www.csn.es/noticias-csn/2025/-/asset_publisher/9iAov9mrc931/content/informacion-sobre-el-estado-operativo-de-las-centrales-nucleares-espanolas). 
His rhetoric was to shift blame to nuclear ([because his government had been demolishing nuclear plants](https://x.com/ada_lluch/status/1916961580790779924)), even though the grid was recovered by reconnecting with France, which uses mostly nuclear. [President Sanchez has also claimed Spain has no uranium for nuclear plants, which is completely false. ](https://x.com/el_pais/status/1920025482478657741)

To be clear, the cause of the blackout is still unknown, but overreliance on solar lacking spin and therefore destabilizing the frequency of the grid seems to be the most plausible explanation. 

Climate change is "our #1 issue", according to the Spanish government. 
In Baccalaureate I was once forced to write an essay about how we can combat climate change in daily life with small actions. 
Like, turning the lights off when not in use. 
I wrote that climate change will be solved through technology and policy, and claimed that sacrificing peace of mind on such daily actions was ridiculous. 
*And I believe it is abusive and manipulative*. Nearly a decade later, I keep reading about people having "climate change anxiety". 
But here are [politicians turning the lights off](https://x.com/herqles_es/status/1903644189214048734), even when most of the grid is already renewables. 

The PR of the government made sure to call the electric grid company "private" every chance it had, despite the Government of Spain being by far the largest shareholder. 

> BTW the president of Red Electrica was placed by the president... has zero background in energy or even STEM

> that woman also chairs Pablo Iglesia's foundation

She also makes 546k euros a year. *That's a lot.* 


## Communist Spain

Spain has many similarities with what you'd expect from a communist regime. 
It doesn't necessarily *feel* like it, but I guess that's also what someone in a communist regime would say. It will become more evident in the next subsections. 
While Spain makes productivity highly costly with a hostile legal and tax environment, it makes fraud permissive: 
squatters are protected by law, industries are highly dependent on subsidies and schemes that favour fraud, and certain forms of fraud are not treated as a crime under thresholds of hundreds of thousands of euros. 
I'll also take advantage of this space to raise that the government is incredibly bureaucratic and slow. 
For any procedure you're normally expected to read a 40-page document of extremely obtuse Spanish legalese, if not multiple. 

### The Propaganda

Power has a veil of propaganda. They use mainstream media to manipulate popular opinion, and engineer narrative. 
Not specific to Spain, it took a lot of digging with my skeptic self to convince myself media is not independent but more like a bunch of dick suckers entangled with centralized incentives. Most don't even notice they're part of the machine. In Spain, this happens mostly in the form of state centralized propaganda, since the central government holds decision power on funding for mainstream media and soft power on narrative generation. 

Here's how propaganda works in mainstream media around the world, from my personal investigation:

> it seems the creation of articles and indexing, even the titles and content, can and do happen before events happen

> by that I mean it's not necessarily MSM having info of events that haven't happened yet, the journalists do have AI generate their articles for things that haven't happened yet, and they might just be guessing

> the more specific it gets the harder it's to believe that, though... the incentives are there to release information in a controlled, causal order, in a practically centralized fashion thereby breaking any barrier across companies, countries or languages. If they do happen to "see the future", good evidence of this sort of corruption is practically inexistent and near impossible to produce.

> Since indexing "can happen anytime", they can and DO post "news" before they happen, and nobody can prove they were not blank pages. They furthermore change their titles, contents, they clip -maybe even alter- the videos they publish... (CNBC, looking at you)

> They receive bonuses based on what they have to write about, based on what the narrative must be, and they cite each other circularly, unreliably, and propagate without source other than reliance on "reputation" through the world...

> Reputation is right the vast majority of the time, they act faster and closer than public information. But then everything they say is taken as The Truth, perhaps frequently or perhaps only once in a blue moon with titles changed, contents changed, and videos clipped. 

> Then, they're free to shape narratives and sell their truth as universal. 

Here in Spain, there was an article published by reputable newspaper *La Vanguardia* about a helicopter crashing into Madrid's tallest tower, and multiple newspapers propagated this piece of breaking news. 
Except it didn't happen. No helicopter crashed into any tower, and X users immediatelly called out the bs. That was just days after they closed down their X account because "X propagates lies". 
To mention, X is the only social network with accurate fact-checking in the form of community notes. 

Spain has officially the "best economy in the world" according to president Sanchez. 
This has been repeated many times in many different forms. 

> Don't mind we have among the highest unemployment rates in the entire EU (and a cost of living crisis), that's far right bullshit 

I believe it refers to some malign interpretation of the recovery of GDP from the pandemic lows; and even then, I would expect that number to surely be [stats hacking of some kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies,_damned_lies,_and_statistics). 
Lately, anything I hear him say on TV is narrative construction; propaganda. 
The economy is very clearly not a rocketship or a motorcycle as president Sanchez keeps repeating. 
Everything that doesn't fit the left's agenda is "far-right hoaxes".
Everyone who thinks differently is dehumanized, tossed into the "far righter" bin:

> can't afford rent, are forced to live with parents, no jobs 

> young people notice the government spends way too much, stagnating the economy

> young people notice they won't have a retirement at this pace and call this out 

> ["It's not the young. They're not ignorant young people. They're far righters, so don't say it's the voice of young people. They are far righters, not young people."](https://x.com/wallstwolverine/status/1884960769759957499 ) -Pablo Iglesias (Podemos)

I hear about it nearly every single day; from both media and government officials. 
The socialist Spaniard first makes you the enemy, then finds a reason to justify their behaviour: and they do it against their own people. 
Transport Minister Óscar Puente has given out multiple insults to right wing X users, and cheered on a doxxing campaign leftists did. 
It goes to such extent, that when defense minister Robles eventually arrived in Valencia, [she was seen confronting the residents](https://x.com/tomasrp3_/status/1860252445651190257) in a flooded garage. 
There's also [controversy](https://europeanconservative.com/articles/news/spains-new-media-law-sparks-fears-of-censorship-and-state-control/) with the government keeping on passing laws that keep giving them suspiciously more power over media as well as immunity. The Spanish institutions are rotten, to the extent that a [corrupt police chief can have multiple luxury cars and go unnoticed](https://x.com/eldebate_com/status/1854977265219915793), but you're fined if you take out 3k euros in cash without a 24h tip to the tax agency. 

21/May/2025 Update because I couldn't miss this:

> the other day I was eating while listening to TV... and it was all propaganda. The *Minister of Equality* said we were still "fighting" against sexism... she said things are "improving a lot" *but they can do better because inequality has been rising* "since covid" (it's actually because of the immigrants, who are even permitted to claim citizenship with a criminal history, not covid; and the opinions turning against the feminist movement is recoil from the obvious brainwashing), and she blamed social media and the far right, before saying they are preparing a massive publicity (propaganda) campaign (with our taxes) to counter social media... 

> The Spanish government is literally a copy of 1984 

> She also mentioned that "the far right" is a "danger to democracy", and that their duty is to change society... 
> She said it like it was the government's duty to change the opinions and values of the people 

### The Charocracy

Spain not only failed in capitalism with 2008, it is also a failed communist country. 
My local gym, managed by the city council, opens at 7am and closes at 9pm. They're only open for six hours on Sundays, and it's almost always packed. 
If you believe a tight opening schedule is *somehow* a positive because "workers deserve time off", I would respond that I would gladly work at my local gym if I had the opportunity, and I believe many unemployed would say the same. Spain has some of the highest unemployment rates across the EU and the developed world, but I'll mention more about that further below.  

Recently, there has been some debate about the sustainability of the pensioner system. Currently, Spain spends about half its annual budget in pensions. 
Pensioners worked and saved during an era of economic expansion; they could afford houses and vacations. 
New births per year have declined steeply, and the result is that old people now own the housing, and the economy in general. 
Yet those pensioners who need no pension, do receive a generous pension. In exchange for that generosity, they only have to keep voting PSOE (or PP, the "right-wing" copy of PSOE). 

Back in the day, multiple working Spaniards paid for one pensioner's needs. The issue is that now, for every pensioner there are only two working Spaniards (and I bet one of them is not even born and raised in Spain). 
Young working people have been reduced to slaves to old people since they don't realistically have a chance to acquire a stake in the economy (or own their own housing). 
When leftists complain about "capitalism", they're unknowingly actually complaining about the older generations pulling the ladder behind themselves; the economy is overwhelmingly owned by the old. 
Not all the old, but even those who did worse with their personal finance are better off than the young, with the state benefits. 
Between social security, income tax, VAT, and others, working people pay more than half their wage in taxes (they're just not aware of it since the employer and businesses pays in their behalf for most of those).
Of that, half goes to pensions, and half to the livelihood of civil servants that provide little to no value, as well as subsidies, benefits and services used overwhelmingly more by older people or for political reasons, including fraudulent contracts. 
Only about a fifth goes to actually useful institutions and services; to build the roads, to the hospitals and teachers, the police and so on. 
Of the little money that remains to the young worker, they have to spend most of it on paying rent to the old who own the housing (...and receive the benefits/pensions). 
**The state holds the monopoly on violence, and it is now being used at the expense of the young.**
The middle aged worker typically stores wealth in the form of a mortgage *or a rent contract protected with price controls*, and with a higher salary can save if they have no children. 
That's why, for the young, their parents' and grandparents' wealth (and their willingness to share it) is **the main factor that separates wealth from poverty**. 
In Spain, there is seldom to no variance in starting salaries; a lawyer will make barely over minimum wage, as will an engineer. *The Spaniard's main way of making their fortune is through inheritance*.

The working population is made up of mostly middle-aged people, in their fourties to mid sixties; young people are about a rounding error. 
However, the young will have it harder if not impossible to defend their interests: they are a minority, and vulnerable to the will of a working class that is looking towards retirement or increasingly state benefits that specifically cater to middle aged workers. 
The *charocracy* (coined from Spanish "charocracia", popularized by  right leaning influencers like [@wallstwolverine](https://x.com/wallstwolverine), and making reference to [middle aged progressive and feminist women](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charo_(t%C3%A9rmino))), is the corruption of democracy into the ruling of an aged population that increasingly depends on leftist and populist policies of the government, and will keep voting for it in order to protect their personal interests, but excusing her own *violence* through a victim-frame where they fight against *Mr. Fascism* and *Mr. Patriarchy*. While these sort of incentives are a trope of socialist dictatorships, Spain is doing it by pretending to be a welfare state, excusing itself in a social contract that doesn't really work anymore with the population collapse. *This is probably the only time **in the history of democracy** that this has happened.* Just like in the past the power was retained by powerful elites, it is now retained by a *selfish middle class* that that will increasingly depend on state benefits, marked by old age and welfare without production, even if that means the decimation of opportunities for the young and their condemnation. 
The interests shared by the old in age into such abusive system are not unique to themselves, but extend to families that expect a fortunate inheritance. 

The fact of the matter is that most of the young population is being replaced by immigrants, and a near-total replacement may happen sooner than later. 
In Spain, there were 322k births in 2024, and of those 31% were of foreign-born mothers. [The government is actively working to replace the young population with immigrants](https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/gobierno/councilministers/paginas/2024/202411119-council-press-conference.aspx), and is now aiming to regularise [300k immigrants a year](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/spain-regularise-about-300000-undocumented-migrants-per-year-2024-11-19/). 
Meanwhile, unemployment of citizens under 25 is around 26%, with some 470k young people willing to take nearly any job. Much of these are degree holders. Meanwhile, the government cites the "need for workers" as a reason for their immigration policies. 
A further ~400k of people under 25 are jobless, and [do not appear in the official statistics](https://english.elpais.com/society/2021-09-17/spain-has-second-highest-percentage-of-young-people-who-neither-work-nor-study-in-eu.html). 
This brings the real joblessness rate for under 25s to an estimation of around 50%. 

<p style="text-align: center;"> 
<b>The youth is being replaced by immigrants.</b>
</p> 

The pensioner system is simply unsustainable; not even in the future, but right now. So the government's move is to import that sustainability (and import the future voters that would perpetuate their power). Even if that were to work ([it won't](https://x.com/merogos_/status/1925173638749212748) unless done through institutional filters), the local youth is rendered unnecessary, and forced to depend on their families (and their welfare) or the government as civil servants. 

> divide [public debt] by the total population, it's not that bad! divide it by the working population.... it's REALLY bad. Then adjust for people who work for the government and we're in a crisis. Further adjust for the expected population collapse and we're in a dystopia. 

> young people without family wealth of any sorts are pretty much, quite literally, slave labour

> it's laughable young people look around and then blame capitalism

> but say, who are the boomers and gen X voting for?

> they're not voting for "the fascists"

> they're voting for the left, the liberals and communists

> Democracy is the god-granted right of the people to change social reality --  and we keep hearing the complaints, and we keep having governments that supposedly worry so much about it all

But no change. The left used to bash the right saying food was getting expensive. 
Now that the left has been in charge for a while, food is *very* expensive. 
They have the power, they vote, they make things worse, then they blame the other side. 
The pensioner issue is just the tip of the iceberg. 
*The larger monster is in the widespread dependency of the voting population to the state in the form of subsidies and state dependent jobs, as well as new forms of welfare that targets the working class.*

### The Revolutionary Fee

In Spain, the little guy is not just disadvantaged, it is actively abused by the government. 
People who work by their own (work by contract or freelancing) must register as "autónomo", and forced to pay exorbitant fees. 

> freelancing is illegal in spain btw

> unless you pay the government their communist extortion

> which is mandatory even if not making any money

> thats why some ppl work in the 'submerged economy', ie. fuck the tax man

> their extortion is literally more than i'd be expected to make, minimum 230 euros/month (besides income and vat taxes), bureaucracy torture and time waste that would suck all my time unless i pay a further communist 100 euros in a communist tax advisor who would do shit wrong anyway, all to make myself subject of potentially further extortion at the whim of spainish tax man

There are many testimonies from youtubers that the tax agency falsely accuses you of not paying tax, set you deadlines for "discounts" for what you "owe" and drag you to court for years; so they offer you to settle with them, and it's generally cheaper to settle with to pay tax you don't actually owe than to pay the lawyers and accountants to defend yourself.
I remember all my experiences in Spain, and the sort of things the tax agency minister says on TV, and financial success starts feeling more like dread! 

> or rather, tax woman because she (the minister) is actually communist 

For employees, while congress every year makes minimum wage non-taxable, they can change that at any moment. 
Recently, they made a strange change to how they tax employees, resulting in [the first 5% over minimum wage to be taxed at 99%](https://x.com/Jongonzlz/status/1909995584942915699), and at about 50% for the fringe up to 126% (21k euros) the minimum wage. This means companies are more incentivized to keep employees at minimum wage, since the employee doesn't see any benefit the 5% over minimum wage, and only half the benefit for another 21%. 
Bear in mind, this is only income tax, which goes from 24% to 45% at 60k euros; there's also social security which is mostly paid by the employer, which at minimum wage is roughly a third of the wage, and then there's the income tax from the local autonomous government... and the new taxes on income they keep coming up with, like the "solidarity fee" (solidarity, with the pensioners). 


<p style="text-align: center;"> 
<b>That was their normal.</b>
</p> 




### The Communist Subsidies

Not only you are required to pay a fee to work at all, the state decides if your work is worth anything at all, once you account for all the subsidies that *you* don't have access to. 

> spent all day long looking into becoming a business intelligence analyst, and turns out there's a government fucking communist program for "digital transition"

> for a moment i thought perro sanxe might have cared about me, since BI activities are included in the subsidy program meaning hiring those services can come free for micro and small enterprises. even better, the requisites to be part of the program were to be unemployed and younger than 35, besides doing a 150h training. sounds like a great chance, i thought. until i found out i need to have had 100k in revenue within the last two years 

> MEANING not only i literally am not allowed to take advantage of the program on a freelance basis, but I am automatically rendered not competitive

(*and this includes pretty much all tech work that used to be able to be done on a freelance basis*)

> because how THE FUCK am I supposed to compete with other people when their labour and ONLY THEIRS is FREE for their clients

> not even professionals with experience qualify since the revenue needs to be as a freelancer 

> there's a fucking license for every fucking thing, and they keep making sure to keep young people out

> I fucking knew there was no chance the Next Gen EU funds were ever going to be a net positive

There are subsidies for **nearly every** industry. 
Every policy program they make looks good on paper, they give it a great name like "Digital Transformation", 
when in reality, such subsidy programs favour low or *negative* productivity and *fraud* (and there has been *so much* of this with the "Digital Transformation"), while keeping the gates well shut to the non-graced and non-fraudulent. From personal experience, my father asked a friend if he could help me get clients for freelance work, and he confirmed what I had found out: clients overwhelmingly prefer to use the subsidies, which not only gatekeep people from work, but it takes an entire year to get paid by the govenment. 

#### The Communist European Union 

I will also call this by what it is: the Next Generation EU funds are an attempt at communism at best, massive money laundering at worst. 
It caught my attention that certain Spanish subsidies are funded by the EU Next Generation funds. 
And I have looked into some of them, because I was interested in breaking into the video game industry, where a main source of funding were Spanish subsidies funded by EU Next Gen. 
So I looked into the projects that got funding, the projects that didn't. The vast majority didn't get funding. 
It turned out, the money might as well have gone to an incinerator. 
My impression was that about a third of those projects were worth the subsidy they were given. 
The rest, could as well have been fraudulent companies specialized in making shit games nobody will play but which tick all the subsidy requirement boxes very well. 
They can't ever technically be determined to be "fraud", but they are; it's called gaming the system. 
The monies go to fund movies nobody wants to watch, games nobody wants to play. 
I looked and it was rotten; do we need to look everywhere to see it is rotten everywhere? 
The money is given to individual small projects, thousands of them, and it would take you to research every one company, from nothing but online public information as I did. 


> just saw on the news the EU is investigating a 8 million euro misappropiation of funds from the EU next generation for the quantum supercomputer of the barcelona supercomputing center

> I remember when the propaganda spokesperson (minister) of the "ministry of science, innovation and education" went on TV to say with this new project young educated STEM people would stop leaving the country for work 

> And I was like LIES fucking propagandist

> I applied there and they didn't even call me back, they only hire boomers with a PhD and 20 years of experience

> And everything I've been shitting on the EU next generation funds, WELL HERE IT IS, will people finally start believing me that Next Gen is a giant communist embezzlement scheme? 


Moreover, I am personally extremely suspicious of the European Union's recent stances, such as with the anti-cryptocurrency stances of the European Central Bank or the survival kit for a "climate change emergency"; 
the only thing that might cause a climate change emergency such as to need a survival kit and stockpile three day's worth of food is nuclear war, because apparently anything that involves negotiating with Russia is being pro-Russia. 
European Federalists demand a EU with a central government "to oppose" right-wing influences like Trump, but the federalists rarely seem to consider the EU *does have* a political spectrum; a EU that only favours only one view as acceptable is destined to evolve into a dictatorship. 

### Spanish Industry


Chains are much less common than in countries like the US or the UK; small businesses are very common, especially in retail, but are individual or family managed, and hence don't increase the employment offer in the market. Starting up is drowned by over-regulation and excessive taxation, as well as a hostile legal environment and tax agency. 
Although there was a recent "Start up law", it is pretty much another communist scheme to bring more Americans to take jobs from the Spanish market. 
The main way to get out of unemployment as a young person here in Spain, it seems, is to become a public servant (or nepotism). 
Normally places open once a year, they're competitive and you're often required to prepare for a set of exams. 
In Spain, entry level positions are rare. Most of the private economy is based around catering the old aged and tourists (such as cafés, restaurants and healthcare, and transport too), and that's where you may have a realistic chance if you have relevant education and experience, or can fake it. The tech sector is saturated, especially as Spain is a destination for Americans and other tech workers from around the world that benefit from low taxes (Beckham Law): the government actively takes the opportunities of the young, and gives them to foreigners.

If I was in the UK I would have been scheduling interviews with multiple places within days. 
Here in Barcelona, Spain, I spent several weeks looking for unqualified work, just to give up. Burger King didn't have any restaurant that was hiring: the closest one was in a town one hour and a half away from the city. 
I eventually found temporary work *through a discord channel*. It was only for three days; my most profitable skill from four years of physics was knowing how to handle paper without cutting my fingers. 
For three days of work, I was paid about 6 euros the hour, and had to wait two months to collect it; less than minimum wage. Update: with one exception, no fast food chain ever got back to me. The one that did get back *for an interview* did so almost *four months* after my application, and they closed their message with "*Happy Day*". 

A role where it is easy to get an interview in Barcelona is as a real estate salesperson with a real estate agency. They invited me to an interview and I expected to be a one-on-one interview; when I arrived, there were about twenty other men in the room. They showed us all a video about their agency, clearly brainwashing to convince their future employee (or potential client) that what they do is ethical. Their approach was for their employees to build trust within their local community and wait for the moment they could sell a home; the selection was based on appearance and openness more than experience, judging from the order they decided to do the interviews in. 
Most "work opportunities" that did not require experience were in aggressive street sales, where young men made money convincing old people to buy something they didn't need, and young women made money getting men drunk to make them agree on something (or so I overheard). 
Another common role is as a "teleoperador" (telemarketing); from what I've heard of someone that had to work such jobs is that most of what they often do is highly unethical.

Meanwhile, on the TV was SUMAR leader Yolanda Diaz celebrating that they had reduced the working week from 40 to 37.5 hours. 
The truth is that it's pure bullshit: this benefits the (government-dependent) middle class, and especially civil servants, like every single decision this government has taken. 
Non-exploitative jobs are not the norm, especially not what poor people are used to (SUMAR pretends to be on the side of poors). 
It is pretty common for bars and restaurants to look for workers who do unpaid overtime, many times doubling the amount of hours they are paid for; I believe they ask for experience even for this, too. 


<p style="text-align: center;"> 
<b>And that was their normal.</b>
</p> 


> meanwhile boomers with two outright owned apartments getting a pension increase above any measure of inflation funded by taxes I can't even pay


### The Benefits 

There is a communist benefit for nearly anything; if not from the central government, from the autonomic government. 
Except we don't have food stamps (you either go ask the church or die, I guess). 
Having a benefit for everything sounds good in theory, but in the practice, sometimes it's just like the food stamps: there are no food stamps. 

As a general rule, the older you are the more benefits you qualify for, but if you're young *and have a stable job* (like those the government offers) you might also be eligible for a number of smaller benefits. 
I won't go over every benefit since that would double the length of this post. 
Being a victim of *gender violence* significantly enhances access to these benefits, to the point that the police has busted "mafias" that generated false accusations for female undocumented north african immigrants to access them. 

One of the most important benefits is the minimal living income, for which the eligibility is considered on the entire household. 
We also have several other similar benefits for middle-aged people (they always have some age requirement). 
Normally every autonomous community has a copy of the same benefits the central government offers (in practice, a small supplement to the central ones), plus a local list. 
However...

> we have a "minimal living income" in Spain, which is similar to UBI if you're not working

> of course, nobody but the wealthy can afford not to work the duration it takes the bureaucracy to process the procedure (about a year iirc) -- this was around 2023

> If you work anytime during that period, you don't receive anything.

> if you're a boomer with a paid for house and wealth abroad you can claim a free wage akin to UBI from the state

> if you're poor chances are you don't meet the requisites for the benefits

> if you're homeless, I guess the state forces you to remain homeless for like an entire year?

Obviously, we all know where this is going. 
Simply put: if you're not living off the state you're a fool. 

### The Civil Servants

When I arrived in Granada the streets near the university looked like some sort of wartime or postapocalyptic scene. Papers flying by, every single wall and light post was full of advertising, for prep courses. 
Specifically, they were advertising for prep courses to do "oposiciones", to become a public servant. Since you need to take exams to become one, it has become a regular thing that the Spaniard learns the relevant content at a prep school, given that the Spanish self-learning culture is so atrophied from all those years of authoritarian schooling. 

In Spain, civil servants are known for being a privileged class: they have a job they legally can't get fired from, do minimum effort (even ignoring customers and being rude), and rake in guaranteed salaries that they would only dream of in the private sector. Since there are only very few job opportunities for graduates in the private sector, many opt for becoming a public servant. 
I don't think it would be an overstatement to say that most students aim to become a public servant. It's sort of like the bee movie. 

### Government Funded Training 

I love this topic because everywhere I go I am bombarded with advertising for government funded training, as if learning one more programming language or tool was going to find me a job (it won't). If you're unemployed you have access to training paid for by the government, pretty much wherever you are. 

> there are WAY too many people living off giving courses on shit you could learn by actually doing something useful

> it's like the quintessential bullshit Spanish job. From the same country with the top high school drop out in the EU

> i'm bombarded with advertising for state funded courses on a daily basis. Learn AI, learn tech, learn how to use a computer... it's ridiculous. 

> So much advertising about job possibilities, when there are no jobs, **so much propaganda about a tech skill gap that doesn't exist**


> The Spanish state is fucking high on superflouously funding pointless courses and then showing off as if they actually did anything positive

> the result is that every fucking corner you go you find a course on whatever the fuck, all funded by the government, which in principle 'sounds good' but in practice, at worst it's a waste of resources once you factor in the sick education mentality people have here, and at best, it's kindergarten for old people

The vast majority of this training is too basic; in sensible countries this sort of training is usually done by the company itself, and simply there is no way anyone could find a job only based on what they'd learn from government funded training; people with way more experience than a "training course" are unemployed. 
It's only meant to keep you distracted from the truth: keep you distracted about the real state of affairs. 
There even was some recent [controversy because of how extremely outdated some government funded courses are](https://x.com/JaimeObregon/status/1899223108529094795). 
What's more, it's as if some of the courses for the unemployed were aimed at old people looking for a hobby. 

> I think the clearest example on the Spanish problem with education is what happened in politics recently. 
> In the Sumar political party, the result of a mix of far left political parties, partially a spiritual successor of Podemos, there was some drama about Iñigo Errejón having sexually assaulted a party member time ago. 
> It was very political because the Spanish left pushed for and passed a "Only Yes is Yes" law which makes all sexual interaction without an explicit "yes" technically illicit (for the man). 
> In the end Errejón ended up declaring the girl lied in some of her statements... though for the most part they were true that Errejón had tried to leverage politics at a desperate attempt "to get laid with someone way out of his league". 
> After a lifetime of chanting the woman must always be believed, and that women don't make false accusations... 

> So the people who try to lecture the entire country about sexual abuse, sexism, male chauvinism, and so on, are condoning what they are so ferociously against... And the leader of Sumar, unfortunately current 'second vicepresident' Yolanda Diaz, was aware of it and remained silent for years since.
And their response to all the drama was very clear, make two girls march making very upset faces in front of all the politicians and TV, and say that the actions they will take about all of this are.....

> to make party members, the same people who are trying to lecture the entire country about gender issues...
> **do a training course!**

#### For Defunding Academia

It's not just bullshit training courses. Not just power-tripping teachers and academics. It's every person whose livelihood is wastefully paid for by the government. Many add little to no real benefit to society. 
Waste spending can be realistically cut by half by only firing those whose jobs add little to no benefit, as DOGE is trying to do in the US. In my circles, that's academia. 
[Academics will always lean left because they live off the government](https://x.com/CarajoStream/status/1843460553538252960).


> the world is at the verge of complete collapse and they worry about their math funding???

> how fucking narcissistic can they be

> [LONG ENOUGH I have pretended I mathematicians make sense, NO 80% of them are just mentally ill and need help, starting by cutting their funding](https://x.com/alz_zyd_/status/1903563337562312912)

I believe that pure mathematics are particularly wasteful, but maybe that's just because of my environment (the greater 'evil' is most often in admin/HR). Within academic circles, these advanced mathematics are referred to as mental masturbation, because that's pretty much all it is; "beauty" and "knowledge" which is only understood by a few people in the world but costs hundreds of thousands to millions of euros per mathematician. 
Except, it's for the most part completely useless knowledge. ["But but maybe mathematics will be useful in the future!" Bro just put the fries in the bag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFUDPqVmTg&t=1s&ab_channel=SabineHossenfelder). 
I don't think the average citizen would see reasonable to pay billions of euros to abstract artists for the sake of their art; imagine if your government paid billions in permanent salaries for the sake of "abstract artists", and at the same time, underfunded art schools! 
Newton did it for free, and so did Einstein. Their wealth only came later with mainstream recognition. 


### For Jobs That Don't Actually Exist

There is rightly a lot of talk about the risk of government debt. This is a problem faced by many countries, including Spain. 
However, Spain (*and the entire developed world*) faces a similar but more immediate, fundamental and greater problem, which only becomes visible to those who suffer it: the relevance of the youth, and The Great Population Collapse. 
In a "black hole debt spiral scenario", a country becomes unable to pay back its public debt as the interest on its debt piles faster than it can pay back. 
Spain can pay it back by importing lots of net positive immigrants from LatAm and the developed world (sun tax, bitch). But there's a similar but much deeper problem that **is now happening** to Spain, and has no easy foreseeable solution: the youngest generations will have no employment. 
Since the population pyramid is so skewed old, and salaries are kept relatively low even for experienced people, and there is a growing cost of living, **employers are massively encouraged to hire older**. 
A common confusion is that "when the middle aged retire", young people will have the opportunity to get a job. 
No, instead of opening opportunities for the young, the job goes to the next person with most experience, at the top of the stack: the population pyramid will become more skewed with time, and the problem will worsen. 
First in, first out. 

> oh the surprise young people are gonna have when they notice
> that unemployment will be 60% for them, then AI will take their jobs, and the only way to make a living for them will be being a parasite civil servant!

> because of course, the government will drag behind the real, AI-powered economy

> I think we're in a sort of situation where the government keeps kicking the can, just like public debt

> that's why funding for university degrees has gone up, why the government has increased spending in bullshit training for the unemployed

> why there are so many degrees out there nowadays. so young people don't go out to work, naively thinking they are "preparing". 

> **They must not find out, that those "jobs" don't actually exist!**

> it's all bullshit to keep people ignorant from what's happening
> and it's gonna accelerate like crazy with AI

I applied to a job as a software developer at a bank. The job ad says one open position; even if it was a hundred open positions they would have already filled. 
My profile fit perfectly with the job requirements but I didn't even get a call. 
They keep it open for months, but the job doesn't actually exist. These are known as ghost jobs, and overwhelmingly *waste the time* of applicants (therefore, in my opinion, should be made illegal). 
I believe most jobs I apply to are like that, they don't really exist, and are just there for internal research, or to fulfill some legal requirement as they wait for their nepo hire. 
At least, everyone in Spain seems to take as common knowledge that in this country, nepotism trumps above everything else. 

> We live in a communist globalist world where the government doesn't even give me a job! What the fucking BULLSHIT do I even live in? Even the fucking soviets had JOBS. 

Previously, I mentioned there are roughly half a million unemployed Spaniards under 25, and a further half a million Not in Education, Employment or Training, adding up to one million jobless. 
Of roughly 3.6 million young adults under 25, 1.5 million are in university, and about 1.1 million in other forms of school (Formación Profesional). Wait, the math is not mathing! We counted the unemployed, the NEETs and the students. Where are the workers? Turns out, [they're in the rounding error](https://elpais.com/economia/2025-01-28/la-tasa-de-desempleo-juvenil-baja-al-25-la-minima-desde-2008.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com). 
And I keep seeing this pattern that when young people are unable to find a job they go back to study, and that every day I see more and more degrees in more and more specific industries, and the youth only becomes competitive in the job market by hyper-specializing. 
I don't think they will all have a job. In my opinion, impossible. They're selling smoke for an industry that doesn't exist and won't exist to the scale they seem to assume. Who needs ten thousand hyper-specialized quantum computing engineers? A year? How many times do you even use a quantum computer. Most importantly, it was not the Assembly engineers who had the most work, but the developers working with abstractions. And you don't need a decade of hyper-specialization to use an abstraction. 

Generative Artificial Intelligence enhances this problem: AI will both make it easier for the unexperienced to make things, and it will make it harder for them to find a job. 
It is expected LLMs will extinguish the role of junior software engineers within several years (or months). Many knowledge based careers will follow, and then the rest. 
Companies rely on "finding the best talent for the best price", and years of experience are universally used as a measure of desirability for hiring. 
So I expect they will just stop hiring young people, as has already started heppening, and keep only hiring middle aged people who learn to leverage AI. 
In the middle to long run, even among the middle aged, most will lose their job to AI and mostly only founding engineer (and probably, certain customer facing roles) will remain. 
So the youth won't even be able to "wait out" (dedicating that time to some skill) until they're 30 to find a job. Especially if they keep giving the jobs to immigrants who are already 40 with more than a decade of experience. This could potentially further decimate population growth of developed countries, assuming no measures taken. 

> interviewing in Spain... as opposed to the UK, here they ask a lot of negative questions

> almost as if interviewing me for "why are you NOT a fit for the job"

> if i ever manage a company i would never ever hire human resources people to do the interviewing lol

> how fucked up does this world need to be for so many of those people to have a job? there's more work as HR interviewing for stuff they don't even understand than the people doing the stuff. here and everywhere. 


## Spanish Society

Spain is a country with high rates of home ownership, of pensioners and middle aged people graced with stable jobs. 
Middle-aged natives are for the most part holding the legacy economy; many in early retirement or living off old money. 
Long-settled middle aged immigrants are for the most part unsatisfied, and for the majority of them, their wealth, if any, has not increased since the day they lost it all with the GFC. 
Students live off the government and their parents, and their normal is to become a public servant or to continue in university indefinitely; doing more bachelor's degrees if need be. 

I attended a politics talk organized by a young circle at a fancy and well known cultural center in Barcelona. The talk was regarding Trump's victory in the 2024 US elections; to note, this circle had no official political subscription and didn't normally discuss politics. 
I found some of the most pretentious people I had ever seen, in just how little welcoming they were to a foreigner, that no less, dressed no lower than them, except for his shoes (...shoes are expensive). 
A professor with an impressive grasp on American history gave part of the talk, and several of what seemed to be the organizers added in their comments. There was a couple round of questions. 
Something that caught my attention is that the professor called Trump pro-Russia in the context of Russia's invasion into Ukraine, when Trump only advocated for peace, and I later asked him about this; 
according to the professor, if you don't advocate for Ukraine to recover all of its territory you are pro-Russian, per the widely accepted definition. 
So, according to him and his accountance of academia, Trump was pro-Russia because he was open to negotiating with Russia to recognize former Ukrainian territories as Russian. 
*Ukraine had suffered one million deaths of their own people* in an atrocious war which it could only endure thanks to the support of the US and the EU... But Trump was *pro-Russian* for wanting to stop it. 

The rounds of questions were a brief back-and-forth about trying to understand the psychology behind Trump voters. 
The group who spoke gave its opinions, and stated the US is very different, demographically, citing that rural voters favoured Trump, 
and about the growing frustration about the American dream with the rising cost of living. 
Immediately, I understood this was the same debate as always, 
"Americans are dumb, as opposed to educated Europeans", but replacing words like 'dumb' with 'rural' or nuances that amount to 'ignorant'.
They raised the point about the "far-right" in Europe, without fulling placing Trump in the same category (he *actually* is a "fascist" to their standards, they just didn't fully dare to believe half of the US would "vote for fascism"). 
One girl asked why immigrants and hispanics seemed to favour Trump in the elections results. 
They amounted it to some sort of selfishness, completely ignoring the obvious that non-citizens can't vote; 
**they brought up they can't fully understand it because they have a *European perspective.*** 
Everyone, perhaps about forty young adults, seemed to agree, with perhaps only one guy who claimed to understand why Americans would vote Trump. 
*They looked convinced saying that something like that wouldn't happen in Europe*. 
They took pride in being European; they are not like the Americans. 
Here in Europe, we always vote for the good guys, except for the "marginal" far-right minority that "we", *intellectual* Europeans can't understand. Right? 

[It turns out that among the young](https://x.com/hermanntertsch/status/1886388227747049825), the "fascist", "sexist", "marginal", "ignorant liars", "anti-intellectual" "climate change deniers", "extremist" *far-right* makes up more than 27% of the young as per vote intention. Whereas, among the young, all of the left makes up roughly 20% of vote intention. The left, grows with age. 

> I attended a talk at the civic centre. I thought it would be nice to try something different and see what the place offers. An astrophysicist gave a talk about the anthropic principle, or at least that's what it was supposed to be. What a charlatan--he didn't technically say anything that was completely made up like other people might do, but it was a very basic talk in which he ended up waving his hands as he talked about... "Quantum" immortality! Everyone in the room was very old, so for a moment I thought that was an interesting way to give all the people in the room some peace about their ever closer death in an ever more atheist population.

> One of the men in the room was very annoyed at this charlatan's quantum immortality, and as the talk yielded itself for discussion he interrupted -- and he called it bullshit, in Catalan.

> I was actually having fun looking at the two old men grow increasingly upset at each other, with the charlatan trying to control the situation and the other man list his complaints, "you won't trick me!". The two men that sat in front of me, I suspected might have been physicists, as they sighed at every "quantum" nonsense and chuckled at the charlatan's statements that showed his lack of experience with physics

> During the charlatan's talk, there was also a woman, probably in her 70s or 80s too, I believe of biomedical or biochemical background, that made some interesting and well informed remarks only time remembers. She seemed to still bear excitement about science, even in her old age, and that was filling.

> among all the old people, in a room whose mean age must have been nearing the 80's, there was a young man at the front, and a young woman at the back. Alas, the young woman was not there for the talk, but worked there, and soon before the talk ended she invited for anyone who'd want to attend another activity that was starting. I looked at the pamphlet, and at the lack of detailed description but finding illustrative imagery, exit the room once the talk is over, and head to reception to ask about the other activity. Maybe I'll see an actual heart and learn something medical! And maybe I'll get a chance to chat with someone-- I thought. I enter a room, finding a group of old people sitting around two tables, and a young man and a young woman hosting the activity at the front. The couple must have been in their early 20's.

> The young couple were talking about the heart, making questions as if the people in the room were in elementary school. Their remarks were so common-knowledge, so slowly pronounced, that I started losing IQ points while I listened to them. About ten minutes after I arrived --the listeners must have already had half an hour or so by then--, they take out bags with stethoscopes, and hand them to us to listen to our own heart. I got to use an stethoscope, which I found interesting for a moment. A reminder we're alive; perhaps, a moment of connection with my younger self from elementary school when we kids were asked to estimate our heart rate.

> The people there were mostly old, but I could also see some ~60 year olds, who must have been feeling very lonely, and making some serious faces, as if they had already given up on doing anything more fulfilling than having a couple twenty year olds talk to them as if they were children.

> That might have been the second time in my life that I learnt that "els cargols no tenen venes"; I deem it unlikely I had never heard of that before, given how much I remember snails being a fundamental part of my elementary education. I couldn't handle five more minutes of being talked to as if I was a five year old, and awkwardly tried to exit the room, which probably took me five more minutes until I finally did.

> Those were probably the two most interesting sounding activities in the civic centre, during what I believe was supposed to be science week.

> In other words, state funded kindergarten for old people.
