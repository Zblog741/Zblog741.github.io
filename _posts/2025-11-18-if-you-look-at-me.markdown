**November 18, 2025.** *A new interpretation of the prologue of Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, a dream, and a death threat.* 

<!--more-->

Today, I felt very lonely. 

So I took a bus for 2AM Popeye's, had an ice cream at McDonald's (see below) and then went back to hike a hill near home. 
When I feel lonely, besides having fast food, I sometimes hike a hill near home, from where the entire city can be seen.

I don't like the hiking itself, nor do I particularly enjoy the views. 

My favorite part is going back down. 

As Zarathustra said, 

> I love those that know not how to live except as down-goers, for they are the over-goers. 

Here are some pictures.

In Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra there is this beautiful symbolism of downgoing and overgoing; ascending and descending. That's why that was on my mind when I hiked that hill for the first time. At first, I wanted to catch the sunrise, failing many times to accomplish it in time. 

## A New Interpretation of the Prologue of TSZ 

I recommend reading [the prologue to Thus Spoke Zarathustra](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1998/1998-h/1998-h.htm), but here is a summary: 

> Zarathustra, thirty years old, after ten years in solitude with only an eagle and a serpent, decides to descend from the mountains because his wisdom feels like an overflowing cup. He speaks to the rising sun and sets out. In the forest he meets an old hermit who once knew him, now living alone and singing hymns to God. The hermit advises him not to bring gifts to people, but Zarathustra continues on, noting privately that the hermit has not heard that “God is dead.” He reaches a nearby town where a crowd has gathered to watch a rope-walker perform above the market square, on a rope stretched between two towers. Zarathustra delivers a speech proclaiming the need for humanity to overcome itself and strive toward the “Superman,” rejecting otherworldly hopes and complacency. When they demand the show, the rope-walker appears and begins to cross. As he walks carefully across the suspended rope high above the square, a second performer dressed like a buffoon bursts from the tower door and follows him, taunting him loudly and calling him names. Approaching quickly, the buffoon leaps over the rope-walker, who becomes frightened, loses his balance, throws away his pole, and falls down through the air into the crowd's midst. The crowd separates in confusion, but Zarathustra remains near the injured man, who is still alive and speaking. Zarathustra reassures him, stays by him until he dies, and promises to bury him with his own hands. After the square empties, Zarathustra carries the corpse out of the town at night. On the road he is warned by the buffoon that many people hate him and he should leave. Zarathustra continues, hides the corpse in a hollow tree to protect it from wolves, sleeps in the forest, and wakes with a new resolve to seek companions rather than address the masses, before continuing with his eagle and serpent.

Here is my takeaway of the numerology. Ten years of solitude may be directly linked to Greek tradition: from the etymology of *myrias* (*myriad*) meaning ten-thousand, ten may represent a human-scale symbol of eternity, or connect to the thousand-year reincarnational cycles described in Plato's *Phaedrus*, where philosopher-souls must undergo three such cycles (3,000 years in total), before reascending to the divine. Similarly, the thirty-year-old mark also mirrors Greek philosophy, such as in the three-millennia required for a philosopher's celestial restoration in *Phaedrus*, and thirty is likewise the age at which candidates are permitted to begin [dialectics](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Dialectic) in Plato's *Republic*. The descent also mirrors Greek philosophy, as seen in multiple Platonic works: for example, the *Allegory of the Cave*, where the truth-bearer must descend again to help others, but also in *The Symposium*, *The Republic*, and elsewhere. In this view, Zarathustra's descent appears to nod toward ancient Greek notions of cyclical existence and Eternal Return, from which Nietzsche developed his own concept of [Eternal Return](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Eternal_return). Furthermore, Jesus is said to have begun his public ministry "about thirty years old". 

Most importantly, the meaning of the rope-walker and the two towers. I believe this is unpublished, and I wonder, truly, am I the only human besides Nietzsche himself who ever understood the prologue to *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*? I don't consider myself knowledgeable enough to keep reading past the prologue (so this is all I have read!), yet I haven't seen any source lay out this interpretation of it. Asking Grok, it turns out Laurence Lampert makes a similar interpretation to mine in *Nietzsche's Teaching: An Interpretation of Thus Spoke Zarathustra*. In any case, this first part of this awkward self-confession personal post is probably the most insightful interpretation of the tightrope walking scene, as per my own criterion, of what is probably the most important part of Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra. 

Famously, Zarathustra says: 

> Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman—a rope over an abyss.

> A dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a dangerous trembling and halting.

> What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal: what is lovable in man is that he is an OVER-GOING and a DOWN-GOING.

In the story of Adam and Eve, in Genesis, God said:

> You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.

Eve, speaking with the serpent, then refers to the tree of good and evil implicitly as the tree that is in the middle of the garden. 

> The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’”

I do find this the most fascinating part of Genesis, for this opens to interpretation, as *both* the *tree of good and evil* and the *tree of life* are named to be in the middle of the garden. Upon eating from the forbidden tree: 

> The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.

I find this an obvious mirror to Nietzsche's tightrope dancing man. If truly I am the first man to put this out there, there's zero reason I should trust anyone but myself on interpreting Nietzsche. The tightrope scene goes as this: 

> Then, however, something happened which made every mouth mute and every eye fixed. In the meantime, of course, the rope-dancer had commenced his performance: he had come out at a little door, and was going along the rope which was stretched between two towers, so that it hung above the market-place and the people. When he was just midway across, the little door opened once more, and a gaudily-dressed fellow like a buffoon sprang out, and went rapidly after the first one. “Go on, halt-foot,” cried his frightful voice, “go on, lazy-bones, interloper, sallow-face!—lest I tickle thee with my heel! What dost thou here between the towers? In the tower is the place for thee, thou shouldst be locked up; to one better than thyself thou blockest the way!”—And with every word he came nearer and nearer the first one. When, however, he was but a step behind, there happened the frightful thing which made every mouth mute and every eye fixed—he uttered a yell like a devil, and jumped over the other who was in his way. The latter, however, when he thus saw his rival triumph, lost at the same time his head and his footing on the rope; he threw his pole away, and shot downwards faster than it, like an eddy of arms and legs, into the depth. The market-place and the people were like the sea when the storm cometh on: they all flew apart and in disorder, especially where the body was about to fall. 

Here, again, we see the ambiguity between the two trees in the middle of the garden: when the buffoon says "In the tower is the place for thee, thou shouldst be locked up", he does not make reference to which tower he means. In Zarathustra's speech, one tower represented Beast, and the other tower represented the Übermensch. Just like in Genesis, when Eve decides to commit sin, she leaves ambiguous which tree she is talking about. The buffoon, when he sees the rope-dancer asks "What dost thou here between the towers?", sounding exactly as God saying "What is this you have done?" (Genesis 3:13) when he sees Adam and Eve covered. "To one better than thyself thou blockest the way!" sounds directly like a parody of God saying "lest they eat from the tree of life too". So, the two towers signify Beast and Übermensch, just like the tree of good and evil (to evolve beyond Beast) and the tree of life (to evolve beyond human). Eating from the tree of good and evil leading to [The Fall of Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_man) directly mirrors to walking down the tightrope leading to the rope-dancer falling to his death. Furthermore, the man fell *just midway across*, mirroring the tree in the middle of the garden. I rest my case. It is also interesting to note that in the prologue Nietzsche says the Übermensch is a sea, and in this paragraph mentions "The market-place and the people were like the sea when the storm cometh on: they all flew apart and in disorder, especially where the body was about to fall", which ironically avoids the falling man "like a storm", while Zarathustra alikens the people in the market-place as the last men (the antithesis of Übermensch... Übermenschen?). 


## A sorrowful dream 

Talking of Nietzsche... About a year ago, I had a dream, which at the time I woke up from convinced it had to be a prophecy... 

> I was at a party, having fun in a room with friends. The last time this happened so innocently, I was probably seven or eight. There was no toxic shit. I didn't doubt anyone, I wasn't the focus of attention, I wasn't taken advantage, and I got well along. I didn't feel ignored; I wasn't lonely. Instead, I was playing with friends. The only thing separating innocent play from sex was my knowledge and will. 

> My father was getting in the way of me feeling at peace, so I wanted to run away. It reminded me of the freedom I saw other children often have -- yet, even without the presence of my parents, something always held me down in life like an anchor in the sea, in everything I did.

> But I didn't do it alone, it was with purpose. In my dream, I first saw them wanting to leave together, a girl and (most likely) a boy. I didn't feel anything negative weighing on me. The friends I had been playing with had already left. The people getting ready to leave, I didn't know at all, whom I had barely spoken at all. I wanted to enjoy the tranquillity of the night, and take the opportunity to become their friend, despite the risks of feeling alienated. 

> In the dark, I grew closer to them, and realized I wasn't any foreigner to them despite barely meeting for the first time. 

> So we escaped and ran away, it was dark at night, and my father came looking for us but we had found and **climbed a platform** by a train station.

> They taught me how to get to **the top** of the platform. And we rested there. My father came looking for us, for us to go back. I was waiting for my friends to run from the spot at any time and I'd go with them but they didn't take the initiative. That's when I was standing, and on my father wanting me in particular to get down I walked forward and forward, with the backhanded intention to turn around and run. Then, something happening in the ground made my father leave. 

> That's when I taught my friends to get **down**. I took that girl's hand, and my other friend's hand too, and I led them to jump **down**. And led them somewhere else: 

> I do remember I was leading, taking the girl behind me by the fall, and she did likewise with the other friend... we followed the train tracks and entered into a tunnel that went **upwards**. It was very dark so we had to grab hands to stay together and not get lost. 

> Walking by the tracks in my dream, it mirrored a similar situation I once lived walking by a road; I was accompanied but unhappy and confused, going back home... in my dream, I was happy, running away from home, and with the safety that a train can't attempt to swerve into us. It was safe danger, or rather, safe from any _human danger_. 

> Furthermore, going into the tunnel, I was **ASCENDING**. I was leading my friends into **ascending**. And I was only holding the girl's hand: there was only safe space for one person at a time. 

> I was leading until we rose up from **the top** of the tunnel, and then it felt like the opposite to darkness: I was admiring the starry night, and somehow, from the momenta, as if seeing Mach's principle in action, I --or rather, the Universe--, had caused us to whip into a sweeping arc.

> The place was beautiful. On a small hill I could see a dozen cats, and an old nice lightpost. It was like the pigeons by home, or the ducks in the Ciutadella Park, but the hill was of resting cats. There was a little wooden house, an empty and abandoned place to hide. **But hide, from what?** There was no longer a need to hide **up there**; the abandoned house wasn't but a convenient cover... from the dirt and cold. 

It truly was a prophecy, until I realized... I had destroyed that dream, by looking away... or by asking someone else to look away. 

## If you look at me I will kill you 

It was around 4AM, and I set to hike the hill again. 
Endless stairs upwards, there is a viewpoint at the top, before a further mountainous track upwards leading to a further viewpoint.
At the viewpoint after the stairs there is a small outdoors parking, where I most often find a cat or two, and a view into the city. 
I had seen the sunrise, the sunset, and seen it during the day; but I couldn't remember seeing the views of the city in the night lately. 

I rested between sets of stairs, and when I finally got to the top with exhausted legs I found a man in a hi-vis vest. 
He said something to me, and I thought he was trying to greet me with a comment I couldn't make out. 
Assuming he was just going out for work, I was happy I had found someone to make small talk with, so as I walked forward, looked at him and said hi back. 

He then said "If you look at me I will kill you". He said that multiple times, actually, and sounded like he was on drugs.  
For a moment I thought of replying "that'd be nice", but my mom had just told me to be careful outside. 

Luckily there was another way out of the viewing spot than where I came from, because turning around with only stairs under me would have put me in a vulnerable position. 
The man did not follow me, so I just kept walking, and descended back towards home. Not that I could run after climbing so many stairs, anyway. I later saw a police car patrolling around, and when I could see them come around again I stopped them and gestured them to speak with them. 

There was a young man driving and a young woman with him, probably around thirty years old, both in shape, and I told them what had just happened. 
The man said "what a scare, no?", with a tone so deadpan and aloof that sounded like Elliot from Mr Robot. 
I started second-guessing this interaction and said "I guess you're not going to do anything about it", given the lack of evidence and the lax laws towards crime in the country; the woman seemed to say something before I was asked to describe the man. Then, as if insisting for an answer, the policeman said again "what a scare, no?" with the same contradictorily aloof tone, that I doubted whether he was being serious; whether he was genuinely surprised, tired of dealing with these sort of reports, or my completely unconcerned way of explaining this had shocked him. Grok's opinion is that he's been through too many such cases, and then I show up and deliver the report like I'm describing the weather. They asked me where I lived, and I replied that I lived two streets further down. They did tell me they would check it out. 

Someone just threatened to kill me if I looked at him. Is this really a scary thing? It sounds more like what I feel every day when I talk with people I appreciate and try to get closer to. Like in [Mieruko-chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mieruko-chan), a girl that has to pretend she can't see the horrible ghosts she sees everywhere. I have to confess, though, that I do feel saddened it happened in the place I go when I am all alone, too. 

> More dangerous have I found it among men than among animals ~Zarathustra
