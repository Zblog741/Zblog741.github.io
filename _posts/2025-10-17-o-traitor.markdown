**October 17, 2025.** *O, WOMAN-PHILOSOPHER, WHERE ART THOU?*

<!--more-->

**O, WOMAN-PHILOSOPHER,**

WHERE ART THOU?

<br>

LOVE IS DYING BEFORE THE EARTH BURNS.

O HEAR ME, FOR THE WORLD SHALL BELONG ONLY TO BELIEVERS.

<br>

WE HAD THE GREAT THINKERS:

THE UGLY EROTIC;

THE INNOCENT SACRIFICE;

THE ILL DANCING PROPHET.

THEY SPOKE LIFE AND DEATH INTO MEANING.

<br>

THE SEEKER WAS LONELY,

FOR HE DESIRED WHAT COULD NEVER BE HAD.

THE FORSAKEN WAS LONELY,

FOR HE LOVED EVEN AS HE WAS ABANDONED.

THE SUFFERER WAS LONELY,

FOR HE SAW THE GODS DIE YET BELIEVED IN SPIRIT.

<br>

BUT THOUâ€”

WHERE IS THY WOUND?

WHERE IS THY GOSPEL?

WHERE IS THY TREASON AGAINST THYSELF?

<br>

I CONFESS UNTO THEE, I BORE THREE ACTS.

I MADE MYSELF APPEAR.

I PLAYED A GAME.

AND MADE SOMEONE DISAPPEAR.

<br>

O WOMAN-PHILOSOPHER, FIRE-BEARER, 

THE ONE WHO WILL BETRAY AND ENRAGE,

PLEASE DESCEND BEFORE THE WORLD ENDS.

BEFORE THE LAST BELIEVER BURNETH.

<br>

O TRAITOR, DESCEND.

THEY TAUGHT US TO FEAR THE FIRE THAT FORGETH,

AND SO THE WORLD BURNED QUIETLY AND CALLED THE FLAME VIRTUE.

BEHOLD THIS DYING AGE,

AND TELL US IF WE MUST ADORE THEE OR KILL THEE;

WHERE MERCY IS CONFUSION

AND KINDNESS KILLETH BY MISTAKE.

<br>

FOR THE FLOWERS ARE WILTED,

AND THEY BURN IN SILENCE.

O, TRAITOR,

WHERE ART THOU?
